AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ THE

ing to its real condition.⁹ All local motion in an
animal first takes place from the contraction of some
particular part. Thus blood is cast into the ventricles
by auricular contraction‚ as shown before, and then
passed on and distributed by the ventricular con-
traction.

I have been interested in getting at the truth of
this matter of local motion. How the initial moti-
vating organ in all animals having a prime motive
spirit is, as Aristotle says in his book De Spiritu,
contractile3 how νευρον is derived from νευω (nuto,
contraho), and how Aristotle had more than a super-
ficial acquaintance with muscles‚ and on that account
referred all motion in animals to nerves and a con-
tractile part, and hence called those bands in the
heart nerves,-—all this I hope to make clear soon, if
I am permitted to demonstrate my observations on
the organic motion of animals and the structure of

muscles.¹⁰

 

⁹ According to present physiological conceptions‚ venous pressure
is great enough to open the anticulo-ventricular valves during dias-
tole, so that considerable blood flows into the ventricles while they are
relaxed and before the auricles start to contract. It is generally
agreed with Harvey that the ventricles have no suction power, but
it is felt that the contractions of the auricles force in only a portion
of the ventricular contents. See Note 4, Chapter IV.

¹⁰ This treatise also disappeared. The derivation of terms is
apparently offered in apology for Aristotle's calling the muscular
bands in the heart “nerves.'' G. A. Borelli (1608—1679), in develop-
ing a mechanical analysis of muscular motion carried over a theory
of contraction caused by a liquid discharge from nerves (De motu
animalium, 1680). For a superb discussion of the physiology of muscle
consult J. F. Fulton's monograph, Baltimore, 1927.
