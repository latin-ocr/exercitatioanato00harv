The Actions and Functions of the Heart

-·-›·-0›0-<e›—-4--

ROM these and other observations I am con-

vinced that the motion of the heart is as follows:

First‚ the auricle contracts‚ and this forces the
abundant blood it contains as the cistern and reser-
voir of the veins, into the ventricle. This being
filled, the heart raises itself, makes its fibers tense,
contracts, and beats. By this beat it at once ejects
into the arteries the blood received from the auricle3
the right ventricle sending its blood to the lungs
through the vessel called the vena arteriosa, but
which in structure and function is an artery; the
left ventricle sending its blood to the aorta‚ and to
the rest of the body through the arteries.

These two motions, one of the auricles, the other
of the ventricles, are consecutive, with a rhythm
between them‚¹ so that only one movement may

 

² The auricular-ventricular rhythm has become an important sub-
ject for investigation and discussion since the introduction of electro-
cardiographic studies by means of W. Einthoven’s (1860—1927) string
galvanometer. See F. H. Garrison's History os Medicine, 3rd Ed„
Phila., 1921, p. 735.

Note the excellent description of the chain of events in the act of
swallowing. Here is an example of that straight-forward mechanistic
description of functional activity in which Harvey so closely approxi-
