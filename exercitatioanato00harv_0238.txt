APPENDI X I

cation has been included heret from it one may get some idea
of the Cavalierian grace of his style. After my friend, Dr. John
Fulton‚ kindly sent me a copy of Moreton’s privately printed
facsimile of the original edition, I found several errors in the
text Ι had used. This fortunately necessitated careful collation,
resulting in some corrections in the English version.

The translation is admittedly free, in the deliberate attempt
to present Harvey’s thought in the current physiological
manner. Thus, while Harvey nowhere actually uses a word
which may be literally rendered “pump,” it is our habit to
refer to cardiac action in some such term.

The differences in Harvey's style through the book imply its
composition at different times. The introduction is far more
vigorous, and in its critical attitude, more characteristically
youthful than any of the remaining seventeen Chapters. The
first chapter, on the other hand, apologizing for the effort,
has the grace and dignity of careful deliberation, and closes
with a classical quotation reflecting the meditative calm of
middle age. The last three chapters add little to the significance
of the demonstration. They illustrate the futility of theoretical
speculation attempting to reconcile opposing points of view
with inadequate data. With microscopical technique un-
developed, Harvey could not see the communications between
arteries and veins. He tried later to study the problem by a
sort of corrosion method‚ but failed to find anything resembling
an anastomosis except in three obscure places. At the time, he
tried to complete his demonstrations by metaphysical arguments
based on the traditional teleology. This was the antithesis of
the method by which he had achieved such brilliant success
in the preceding chapters.

The last of the book seems to have been written some time
after the main part of it, when long reflection on the subject
had crystalized his opinion. The eighth chapter is similar in
style and context to the fifteenth and sixteenth‚ and was, I
think, written at about the same time.
