AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

sometimes be aware of a pulsation in the teeth,
fingers or inflammatory tumors, other times not. By
this symptom I have diagnosed fever in children,
whose pulse is naturally rapid anyway. By holding
tightly the fingers of a young and delicate person I
can easily perceive pulsation there when the sever is
high.

On the other hand, when the heart beats more
feebly, as in fainting, hysteria, asphyxia, and in the
very weak and moribund, it is impossible to feel a
pulse not merely in the fingers, but even at the wrist
or temple.

Here, lest they be deceived, surgeons should be
advised that when blood flows with force from a
wound, in amputations‚ or in removing a fleshy tumor,
it always comes from an artery. Not always in spurts‚
however, since the small arteries may not pulsate,
especially if compressed by a bandage.

Further, here is the same reason why the vena
arteriosa not only has the structure and walls of an
artery but also why it does not differ so much from
the veins in the thickness of its walls as the aorta.
The latter sustains a greater impulse from the left
ventricle‚ than the former from the right. The walls
of the pulmonary artery are softer in structure than
those of the aorta to the same extent as the walls and
flesh of the right ventricle are weaker than those of

 

dilatation, another important factor in determining blood pressure·
Harvey correctly notes vascular dilatation in local inflammatory
reactions‚ and cutaneous vascular dilatations in sever.
