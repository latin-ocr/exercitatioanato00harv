MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

plants. This seems also to occur in insects which
hide away in winter and appear dead or show a
vegetative vitality. But that it happens in red-
blooded animals³ as frogs, turtles, or serpents may
justly be doubted.

In larger, warmer, red-blooded animals there is
need for something with greater power to distribute
nourishment. So, to fishes, serpents, lizards, turtles,
frogs and such like, a heart is granted with both
an auricle and ventricle. Thus it is very true, as
Aristotle contended (De Part. Animal„ Lib. 3),
that no red-blooded animal lacks a heart, by whose
beat the nourishing liquid is not only stirred up
more vigorously than by an auricle, but is propelled
farther and more quickly.

In still bigger, warmer, and more perfect animals
with more fervent and spiritous blood, a more
robust and fleshy heart is needed to pump the nutri-
tive fluid with greater force and speed, on account
of the size and density of their bodies. Further,
because the more perfect animals need more per-
fect nourishment and more native heat, that the
aliment may be better concocted⁴¹ and delivered,

 

³Harvey just says “blooded animals.'' The oxygen carrying
pigment in invertebrates is not the iron containing hemoglobin but
a copper containing hernocyanin‚ which is not red colored. ἱ

⁴ It is interesting to watch the valiant groping towards the facts
regarding the oxygenation of blood in the lungs. The idea expressed
is'that in order better to “perfect'’ blood from the food, more heat
is needed for the process in the liver, and, as was generally recog-
nized, a draft of air promoted burning and heating. But the tradi-
tional doctrines, which Harvey follows in his teleological speculations
