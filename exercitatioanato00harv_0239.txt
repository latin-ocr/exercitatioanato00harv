TRANSLATOR’ S POS TSCRI P T

The argument in the other chapters from two to fourteen
proceeds with certain characteristics that introduced an entirely
new method of approach in physiological problems. These are
(1) the careful analysis of phenomena observed (chapters two
to five); (2) the devising of experimental procedures to test a
proposed hypothesis (chapters ten, eleven‚ and thirteen), and
(3) the startling innovation of quantitative reasoning to prove
a proposed theory (chapters nine, ten, and thirteen). Harvey
was among the first to use the practical methods of science as
we do now: observation, hypothesis, deduction, and experi-
ment. This is neither scholastic Aristotelianism nor Bacon’s
laborious accumulation of data and its manipulation by the
cumbersome tables of the Novum Organum. The sixth and
seventh Chapters, on the pulmonary circulation, are puzzling.
There is a good discussion of the comparative and embryological
aspects of the subject, and then a peculiar use of the traditional
authority of Galen as evidence. One may find almost all kinds
of logie in Harvey.

In order to bring out the significance of Harvey’s work in
regard to our modern knowledge of cardiac function‚ and to
relate it to the slow development of this knowledge, footnotes
have been added to the translation. I hope they will appeal to
medical students and interested laymen. For specialists in the
history of medicine, they may seem superfluous, in spite of my
effort to make them as brief and inconspicuous as possible.
Most of the information in them has been culled from the
standard authorities in physiology and its history. A running
account of the development of Harvey’s demonstration and its
influence was to have been appended, but will have to wait
till later. A chronology of his life has been added. For my
information and point of view I am indebted to a host of
Harvey enthusiasts, Haeser, Willis, Munk, Foster, Dalton,
Curtis‚ Osler, D’Arcy Power, Hemmeter‚ Garrison, and Singer.

For scholarly inspiration I am grateful to Dr. George Sarton,
Dr. Percy Dawson, and Dr. William Snow Miller. For cheerful
