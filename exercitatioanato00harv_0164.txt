sis or joining of the arteries and veins‚ and they transfer
blood and spirit equally from each other by invisible and
very small passages. If the mouth of the pulmonary
artery always stayed open and Nature had no way of
closing it when necessary or of opening it again, the
blood could not transfuse through these invisible and
delicate pores in the arteries during the contraction of
the thorax. All things are not equally attracted or ex-
pelled. Something light is more easily drawn in by the
distention os the part, and pushed out in contraction
than something heavy. Likewise anything is more quickly
passed through a wide tube than through a narrow one.
When the thorax contracts, the pulmonary veins, strongly
compressed on all sides, quickly expel some os the spirits
in them, and take some blood from these tiny mouths.
This could never happen if blood could flow back into
the heart through the large opening of the pulmonary
artery. Thus, its return through this great hole being
blocked, and being compressed on every side, some of it
filters into the arteries through these small pores.'’
Shortly after, in the next chapter: “The more
powerfully the thorax contracts, squeezing the blood, the
more tightly do these membranes, the sigmoid valves,
close the opening, so that nothing flows back.” A little
before in the loth chapter: “Unless the valves be
present, much difficulty would follow. The blood would
follow this long course in vain, flowing in during the
distention of the lungs and filling all the vessels in it,
outwards during the constrictions, and tide-like, as
- Euripus,flow back andforth in a way not suited to the
