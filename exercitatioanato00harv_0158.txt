AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ THE

of animals with lungs, while the lungs are not used,
as in those animals themselves without lungs.

So it seems obviously true in the fetus that the
heart by its beat transfers blood from the vena cava
to the aorta by as open a passage as if in the adult,
as I have said, the two ventricles were united by
removing the septum. Since these ways for the pas-
sage of blood are so conspicuous in the majority of
animals‚-—indeed in all at certain times‚—we must
examine another matter. Why may we not conclude
that this passage is made through the substance of
the lungs in warm-blooded adult animals as man?
Nature made these ways in the embryo at a time when
the lungs were not used, apparently because of the
lack of a passage through them. Why is it better, for
Nature always does what is best, to close completely
to the passage of blood in adolescence those open
ways which are used in the embryos of so many
animals‚⁴without opening any others for this transfer
of blood?

The situation is such that those who seek the ways
in man by which blood reaches the pulmonary vein
and left ventricle from the vena cava, will do best to
proceed by animal experimentation.² Here the reason

 

² Most ofHarvey's doctrine was developed from studies in compara·
tive anatomy and physiology. He was acutely aware of the value of
animal experimentation‚ which had already been specifically recom-
mended by Vesalius (1514-1564) and Realdus Columbus (1516—1559).
There is evidence that Harvey deplored the suffering involved in ani-
mal experimentation‚ and that he spoke feelingly on it. (S. Weir
