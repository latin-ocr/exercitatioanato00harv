MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

for they are placed where there are no branches
at all, although I confess they are more frequently
seen where there are branchings. Nor are they
present for slowing the flow of blood from the center
of the body, for it seems likely it would flow slowly
enough anyway, as it would then be passed from
larger to smaller branches, become separated from
the source and mass, and be moved from warmer
to cooler places.

The valves are present solely that blood may
not move from the larger veins into the smaller ones
lest it rupture or varicose them, and that it may
not advance from the center of the body into the
periphery through them, but rather from the
extremities to the center. This latter movement
is facilitated by these delicate valves, the contrary
completely prevented. They are so situated that
what may pass the horns of a set above is checked
by those below, for whatever may slip past the
edges of one set is caught on the convexity of those
beyond, so it may not pass farther.

I have often noticed in dissecting veinsâ€š that no
matter how much care I take, it is impossible to
pass a probe from the main venous trunks very
far into the smaller branches on account of the
valvular obstructions. On the contrary it is very
easy to push it in the opposite direction, from the
branches toward the larger trunks. In many places
a pair of valves are so placed that when raised they
join in the middle of the vein, and their edges are
