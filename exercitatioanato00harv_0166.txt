AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ THE

pulmonary vein as a result of the heart beat and
the movement of the lungs and thorax. (Consult
Hofmann's excellent Commentary on Galen's 6th
Book, De Usu Part„ which I saw after writing this.)⁴
The heart, further, continually receives blood in its
ventricles, as into a cistern, and expels it. For this
reason, it has four kinds of valves, two regulating
inflow, and two outflow, so blood will not be in-
conveniently shifted back and forth like Euripus,
neither flowing back into the part from which it
should come, nor quitting that to which it should
pass, lest the heart be wearied by vain labor and
respiration be impeded. Finally, our assertion is
clearly apparent, that the blood continually flows
from the right to the left ventricle, from the vena
cava to the aorta, through the porosities of the
lung.

Since blood is constantly sent from the right
ventricle into the lungs through the pulmonary

dorf, and well recognized as one of the leading authorities on Galen.
The book to which Harvey refers, Comment. in Galen. de usu part.,
was published at Frankfort in 1625 (H. Haeser, Gesclzichte der Medicin,
Jena‚ 1881, Vol. 2, p. 264). In 1636, Lord Arundel took his friend
Harvey with him on a diplomatic mission to Vienna regarding a
peace during the Thirty Years' War. Harvey wrote to Hofmann, offer-
ing in a very manly way to demonstrate his doctrines, which he had
heard Hofmann opposed. See R. Willis’ translation for the Sydenham
Society, 1847, p. 595. “Tradition says that Harvey actually gave this
demonstration in public, and that it proved satisfactory to everyone
except Hofrnann himself. The old man-then past the grand cli-
macteric—remained unconvinced, and as he continued to urge ob-
jections, Harvey at length threw down his knife and walked out of
the theatre’' (D’Arcy Power’s William Harvey. Lond.‚ 1897, p. 114).
