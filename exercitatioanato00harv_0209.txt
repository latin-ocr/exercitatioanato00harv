MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

for general use, referring not to that specifically
used in the coronary arteries and veins, but to the
general reserve in the cavities of its auricles and
ventricles‚ since all the others have a blood supply
for their own particular use. The heart alone is
so situated and constructed as a reservoir and
fountain that blood may be apportioned from it
and distributed by its beat to all regions according
to the size of the artery serving thern.

Moreover, force and effort, such as given by the
heart‚ is needed to distribute and move the blood

this way. Blood easily concentrates toward the .

interior, as drops of water spilled on a table tend to
run together, from such slight causes as cold, fear,
or horror. It also tends to move from the tiny veins
to the intermediate branches and then to the larger
veins because of the movements of the extremities
and the compression of muscles. So it is more in-
clined to move from the periphery toward the in-
terior, even though valves offered no opposition
to the contrary. Therefore, blood requires force
and impulse to be moved from its origin against
its inclination into more narrow and cooler channels.
Only the heart can furnish this, and in the manner
already described.
