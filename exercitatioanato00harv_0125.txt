CHAPTER Ι

The Author's Reasons for Writing

HEN I first tried animal experimentation for

the purpose of discovering the motions and
functions of the heart by actual inspection and not
by other people's books, Ι found it so truly difficult
that I almost believed with Fracastorius,¹ that the
motion of the heart was to be understood by God
alone. I could not really tell when systole or diastole
took place, or when and where dilatation or constric-
tion occurred, because of the quickness of the move-
ment. In many animals this takes place in the
twinkling of an eye,'like a flash of lightning. Systole
seemed at one time here, diastole there, then all
reversed, varied and confused. So Ι could reach no
decision, neither about what I might conclude myself
nor believe from others. I did not marvel that
Andreas Laurentius wrote that the motion of the
heart was as perplexing as the flux and reflux of
Euripus2 was to Aristotle.

sive Morbi Gallici (1530).

of its tide.
