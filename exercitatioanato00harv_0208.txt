AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

ever the source is damaged, nothing, as Aristotle
says (De Part. Animal„ lib. 3), can help it or any-
thing depending on it. Perhaps, by the way, this
is the reason why anguish‚ love, jealousy‚ worry,
and similar mental states are accompanied by emacia-
tion, wasting away, and other bodily changes pre-
disposing to disease and consumption in rnen. A
mental disturbance provoking pain, excessive joy,
hope or anxiety extends to the heart, where it
affects its temper, and rate, impairing general
nutrition and vigor. It is no wonder many serious
diseases thus gain access to the body, when it is
suffering from faulty nourishment and lael< of
normal warmth.

Further‚ since all animals live by food digested
internally, the distribution of this concoction must
be achieved‚ and hence there must be a place where
the aliment is perfected and from which it is ap-
portioned to the separate members. This place is
the heart. It is the only organ containing blood

 

very uncertain. Harvey was apparently quite interested in the mind·
body problem as may also be noted in his De generatione, 1651. How
was it that he failed to pick up valvular lesions of the heart in his
many autopsies? Certainly to so keen an observer the effects of an
insufficient or stenotic value would have been obvious, in the light
of his discovery. But these significant aspects of cardiac pathology
had to wait a couple more centuries to be appreciated. The ancient
Greeks commented upon the obvious effects of strong emotion on
cardiac action. This may have been one reason why Empedocles
and Aristotle made the heart the abiding place of thought. Even the
ancient Jewish scribe wrote that “every imagination of the thoughts of
his beart was only evil” (Genesis 625).
