MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

spirits. Then they declare with Galen that blood
is contained in the arteries, and not spirits, contrary
to Erasistratus.

It is clear that these opinions are so contradictory
and irreconcilable that all are doubtful. Blood is
to be found in arteries, and blood alone, as is plain
from the experiment of Galen, from arteriotomy,
and from wounds. By cutting open a single artery,
as Galen states more than once, all the blood may
easily be drained from the whole body in a half
hour’s time. The experiment of Galen referred to
is this: “If you will place two ligatures around an
artery and make a longitudinal incision in the -
portion of the artery between them, nothing but
blood will be found.’' Thus does he prove the ar-
teries contain blood alone. We may reason similarly.
Finding the same blood in veins, tied off in a similar
manner, that is found in arteries (as I have fre-
quently noted in dead and living animals), we may

 

the lungs instead of in the heart. Foster thinks (Hist. of Physiol.,
1901, p. 30) he cribbed the description from the unfortunate religious
fanatic, Michael Sex-vetus (1510-1553)‚ who was burned under Calvin
at Geneva. The latter’s Restitutio Christianismi (1 5 5 3) contains a
remarkable passage discussing the pulmonary circulation, but since
only 3 copies escaped the flames, it obviously could have little influence.
Servetus had studied anatomy in Paris with Vesalius. Galen (131-201
A.D.) showed that arteries contained blood, contrary to the opinion of
the earlier Greeks, as exemplified by Erasistratus of Alexandria
(3rd Century B.C.) who found the arteries empty in dissections ofdead
bodies. Harvey discusses all these points later.

I have broken into shorter paragraphs, for greater ease in reading,
a couple of very long paragraphs through here in the original.
