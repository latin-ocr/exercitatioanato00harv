MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

No one denies that all the ingested nourishment
may pass through the liver to the vena cava in man
and all large animals. If nutrition is to proceed,
nutriment must reach the veins, and there appears to
be no other way. Why not hold the same reasoning
for the passage of blood through the lungs of adults,
and believe it to be true, with Columbus, that great
anatomist, from the size and structure of the pul-
monary vessels, and because the pulmonary vein
and corresponding ventricle are always filled with
blood, which must come from the veins and by no
other route except through the lungs? He and I
consider it evident from dissections and other reasons
given previously.

Those who will agree to nothing unless supported
by authority, may learn that this truth may be con-
firmed by the words of Galen himself, that not only
may blood be transmitted from the pulmonary artery
to the pulmonary vein, then into the left ventricle,
and from there to the arteries, but that this is ac-
complished by the continual beat of the heart and
the motion of the lungs in breathing.

There are three sigmoid or semilunar valves at
the opening of the pulmonary artery, which prevent
blood forced into this pulmonary artery from flowing
back into the heart. Galen clearly explains the func-
tions of these valves in these words (De Usu Part„
Lib. 6, cap. JO): “ There is generally a mutual anastomo-
