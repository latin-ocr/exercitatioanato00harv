The Circulation of the Blood is Confirmed
by Plausible Methods

T WILL not be irrelevant here to point out

further that even according to common ideas,
the circulation is both convenient and necessary.
In the first place, since death is a dissolution re-
sulting from lack of heat, all living things being
warm, all dying things cold (Aristotle, De Respir.,
lib. 2 {9³ 3, De Part. Animal„ eta), there must be a
place of origin for this heat. On this hearth, as it
were, the original native fire, the warming power
of nature, is preserved. From this heat and life may
flow everywhere in the body, nourishment may come
from it, and on it all vegetative energy may depend.

That the heart is this place and source of life, in
the manner just described, I hope no one will deny.

The blood, then, must move, and in such a way
that it is brought back to the heart, for otherwise
it would become thick and immobile, as Aristotle
says (De Part. Animal„ lib. 2), in the periphery
of the body, far from its source. We note that
motion always generates and preserves heat and
spirit, while in quietness they disappear. So the
blood, in the extremities, thickens from the cold
