MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

the pulse in an artery is due to an impact of blood.
Why do the arteries differ so much from veins in the
thickness and strength of their walls? Because they
must withstand the pressure of the pumping heart
and rushing blood.

Hence, since Nature makes nothing in vain, and
does the best everywhere, the nearer arteries are to
the heart the more do they differ from veins in struc-
ture. Here they are stronger and more ligamentous,¹⁷
but in their terminal branchings, as in the hands,
feet, brain, mesentery, and testicles, they are so simi-
lar to veins in make up that it is hard to tell one from
another by ocular examination of their tunics. This
occurs from the following good reason: the farther an
artery is away from the heart the less it is reached by
the cardiac pressure dissipated by the long space.
Since all the arterial trunks and branches must be
filled with blood, the cardiac impulse is further dimin-
ished, divided in a way by each branching.

So the terminal arteries appear like veins, not only
in structure, but also in function, for they rarely show
a perceptible pulse unless the heart beats more vio-
lently‚ or the arteriole dilates or is more open at the
particular point.¹⁸ Thus it happens that we may

thought of using a word which conveys the meaning he so clearly
implies.

elasticity of blood-vessel walls, a factor of considerable importance
in determining blood pressure.
