MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

heart‚ the artery leaves at the upper. Now, pinch-
ing off the vena cava with a forceps or between
finger and thumb, the course of blood being inter-
cepted some distance below the heart, you will
see that the space between the finger and the heart
is drained at once, the blood being emptied by the
heart beat. At the same time, the heart becomes
much paler even in distention, smaller from lack
of blood, and beats more slowly, so that it seems
to be dying. Immediately on releasing the vein,
the color and size of the heart returns to normal.

On the other hand, leaving the vein alone, if you
ligate or compress the artery a little distance above
the heart‚ you will see the space between the com-
pression and the heart, and the latter also, become
greatly distended and very turgid, of a purple or
livid color, and, choked by the blood, it will seem to
suffocate. On removing the block‚ the normal
color, size, and pulse returns.

This is evidence of two kinds of death, failure
from a lack, and suffocation from excess. In these
examples of both, one may find proof before his
eyes of the truth spoken about the heart.
