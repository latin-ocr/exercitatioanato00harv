CHAPTER XIII

The Third Proposition is Proven‚ and the
Circulation of the Blood is Demonstrated

from it
···>-—->-o<—-—‹···

O FAR we have considered the amount of blood

flowing through the heart and lungs in the
body cavity, and similarly from the arteries to the
veins in the periphery. It remains for us to discuss
how blood from the extremities gets back to the
heart through the veins, and whether or not these
are the only vessels serving this purpose. This done
we may consider the three basic propositions proving
the circulation of the blood so well established,
so plain and obvious, as to force belief.

This proposition will be perfectly clear from a
consideration of the valves found in the venous
cavities, from their functions, and from experiments
demonstrable with them.

The celebrated anatomist‚ Hieronymus Fabricius
of Aquapendente, or, instead of him, Jacobus Syl-
vius, as Doctor Riolan wishes it, first described
membranous valves in the veins, of sigmoid or
semilunar shape‚1 and being very delicate eminences

pupil of G. Fallopius (1523-1562) who was in turn the pupil of Ve-
salius (1514-1564). It was their establishment of modern anatomy
