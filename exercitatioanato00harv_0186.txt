AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

who is lean, with large veins, warm after exercise
when more blood is going to the extremities and the
pulse is stronger, for then all will be more apparent.

Under these conditions, place on a ligature as
tightly as the subject can stand. Then it may be
observed that the artery does not pulsate beyond
the bandage, in the wrist or elsewhere. Next‚ just
above the ligature the artery is higher in diastole
and beats more strongly, swelling near the ligature
as if trying to break through and flood past the
barrier. The artery at this place seems abnormally
full. The hand, however, retains its natural color
and appearance. In a little time it begins to cool
a bit, but nothing is “drawn’' into it.

After this bandage has been on for some time,
loosen it to the medium tightness used, as Ι said,
in blood-letting. You will see the whole hand at
once become suffused and distended, and its veins
become swollen and varicosed. After ten or fifteen

 

experimental measurements reported in his Statistical Essays: Haaemo-
dynamics, 1733. A valuable account of Hales has been given by
P. M. Dawson (Johns Hopkins Hosp. Bull.‚ 15: 185, 232, 1904).
Further advance was made by J.-L.-M. Poiseuille (1799-1869), whose
haemodynamometer was introduced in 1828, and whose studies on
capillary flow appeared in 1840 (Compt. rend. Acad. sc., 1 1: 961.1041).
In 1847 Carl Ludwig (1816-1895) invented the graphic method of
recording blood-pressure, and thus greatly facilitated all phases of
physiological analysis (Muller’s Arch. Anat. Physiol.‚ 1847, p. 242).
A method for determining venous pressure in man was devised by
J. A. E. Eyster and D. Hooker (Johns Hopkins Hosp. Bull.‚ 19: 274,
1908). For a general disussi0n‚ see W. H. Howells' Physiology, loth
Ed„ Phila.‚ 1927, p. 475. Also Journ. Am. Med. Asso„ 91: 31 (July 7)
1928.
