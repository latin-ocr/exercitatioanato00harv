AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

These and other similar inconveniences beset the
traditional opinions about the pulse and the func-
tions of the arteries. Those maintained on the func-
tion and beat of the heart are perhaps no less in-
volved in many tangled difficulties. The heart is
commonly said to be the source and factory of the
vital spirits, from which life is given to the different
portions of the body, yet that the right ventricle
makes spirits is denied,—it merely gives nourishment
to the lungs. So it is said that the right ventricle of
the heart is lacking in fishes (indeed in all animals
in which there are no lungs), and that the right
ventricle exists for the sake of the lungs.

1. The structure of both ventricles is practically
the same. There is the same fabric of fibers, braces,
valves, vessels, auricles‚ and both on section are
filled with similar dark colored and coagulated
blood. Why, then, should we imagine their func-
tions to be so different when the action, movement,
and beat of both are the same? The three tricuspid
valves at the entrance to the right ventricle are a
hindrance to the return of blood into the vena cava.
The three semilunar valves at the opening of the
pulmonary artery are placed to prevent back flow
of blood. Why, then, when there are similar struc-
tures in the left ventricle‚ should we deny them a
similar purpose, of hindering at one place the
escape, at the other the rel-lux of the blood?

2. When the size, shape, and position of these
structures are almost the same in the left ventricle
