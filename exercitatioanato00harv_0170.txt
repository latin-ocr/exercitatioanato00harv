AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ THE

Nature, making nothing in vain, would not have
given these vessels such relative greatness uselessly.
Then I thought of the arrangement and structure of-
the valves and the rest of the heart. On these and
other such matters I pondered often and deeply.
For a long time I turned over in my mind such
questions as, how much blood is transmitted, and
how short a time does its passage take. Not deeming
it possible for the digested food mass to furnish such
an abundance of blood, without totally draining
the veins or rupturing the arteries, unless it some-
how got back to the veins from the arteries and re-
turned to the right ventricle of the heart, I began
to think there was a sort of motion as in a circle.
This I afterwards found true, that blood is pushed
by the beat of the left ventricle and distributed
through the arteries to the whole body, and back
through the veins to the vena cava, and then re-
turned to the right auricle‚just as it is sent to the lungs
through the pulmonary artery from the right ventricle
and returned from the lungs through the pulmonary
vein to the left ventricle, as previously described.
This motion may be called circular in the way
that Aristotle says air and rain follow the circular
motion of the stars.¹ The moist earth warmed by

 

¹ In spite of his own extraordinary discoveries‚ Harvey was re-
markably conservative. N. Copernicus (1473-1543)‚ J. Kepler (1571-
1630), and G. Galilei (1564-1642) had overthrown the Ptolemical
theory of the circular motion of the stars in the heavenly spheres,
but Harvey seems never to have heard of their studies.
