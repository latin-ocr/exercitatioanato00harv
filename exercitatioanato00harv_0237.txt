TRANSLATOR’S POSTSCRIPT

Veritas nos liberabit

As far as I can find, this is the third attempt to render Har-
vey’s classic into current English idiom. The first, which I
have not seen, was apparently an anonymous effort prefaced
by a Zachariah Wood of Rotterdam‚ and printed by Francis
Leach for Richard Lowndes of London‚ in 1653. This octavo
was reprinted in 1673. The second was the well known trans-
lation made for the Sydenham Society by Robert Willis and
published in 1847. Reprinted in London in 1889, in Canterbury
in 1894, and in Everyman's Library in 1907, this has become the
standard English version. Although an excellent translation,
its stilted and involved phraseology makes it rather difficult
reading for those more accustomed to present diction. As
Mencken has intimated in connection with similar classics,
this greatly interferes with their proper appreciation. From
my rather limited experience with medical students and physi-
cians, I am confident that they would welcome the chance to
study the works of the great contributors to their profession
were these to be offered to them in an attractive and easily
readable form.

This prompted Mr. Thomas to suggest, when we discussed a
tercentennial edition of Harvey's great book, that a new trans-
lation in the language and spirit of our times be attempted.
Using Willis as a “pony,'’ this has been an easy and delightful
task. In his more scientific passages, Harvey is remarkably
terse and snappy, in the current style. In his philosophical dis-
cussions he becomes vague and his sentences grow beyond
control, but whose do not?

Not possessing a copy of the first edition, the basis of my
translation was the miserably printed Longhine edition of 1697,
which omits the dedication. Willis's translation of the dedi-
