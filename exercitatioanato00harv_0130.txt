AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ THE

From these facts it seems clear to me that the
motion of the heart consists of a tightening all over,
both contraction along the fibers, and constriction
everywhere. In its movement it becomes erect,
hard, and smaller. The motion is just the same as
that of muscles when contracting along their ten-
dons and fibers. The muscles in action become tense
and tough, and lose their softness in becoming hard,
while they thicken and stand out.3 The heart acts
similarly.

From these points it is reasonable to conclude that
the heart at the moment it acts, becomes constricted
all over, thicker in its walls and smaller in its ven-
tricles, in order to expel its content of blood. This
is clear from the fourth observation above in which
it was noted that the heart becomes pale when it
squeezes the blood out during contraction‚ but
when quiet in relaxation the deep blood red color
returns as the ventricle fills again with blood. But

 

³ Niels Stensen (1638-1686), the Danish anatomist who later became
a bishop of the Roman church, is usually credited with recognizing
the muscular character of the heart (De Musculis et Glandulis Observa-
tionum Specimen‚ 1664). This is a little unfair to Harvey, and, for that
matter, to the unknown author of the Hippocratic tract on the heart
to which Harvey refers in Chapter XVII. Stensen, as far as I can de-
termine, did little more than these in comparing the heart's contraction
to that ofa muscle, and then saying that it is nothing more than muscle.
The structural (histological) similarity between the heart and muscle
was shown in A. Leeuwenhoek’s (1632—1723) Arcana Naturae (Delft‚
1695), in which Epistola 82 (page 445) gives the first clear account of
the peculiar structure of cardiac muscle, with excellent illustrations.
For an interesting account of Stensen, see Dr. W. S. Miller’s paper,
Johns Hopkins Hosp. Bull., 25: 44 (Feb.) 1914.
