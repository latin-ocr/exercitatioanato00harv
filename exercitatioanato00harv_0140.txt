single weak and feeble beat to two or three pulsa-
tions of the auricles.3

With the auricles still pulsating after the heart
has stopped‚ it is noteworthy that a finger placed
on the ventricles perceives the separate pulsations
of the auricles for the same reason as the beat of the
ventricles in the arteries is felt, because, as was
said before, of the distention from the impact of

 

³ The first observation of heart-block. The great Haller (1708—
1777) later postulated a peristaltic muscular wave from the vena cava
to the aorta over the heart, but Moritz Schiff (1823-1896), by noting
again what Harvey had observed in the dying beart, showed this con-
cept untenable. The term “beart-block” was introduced by W. H.
Gaskell (1847—1914), in his masterful analysis of the heart beat (Phil.
Tr„ Lond., 173: 933, 1882) which soundly established the “myogenic’'
theory of the movement. In this treatise “it is shown that the motor
influences from the nerve ganglia in the sinus venosus influence the
rhythm (rate and force) of the heart, but do not originate its move-
ments or beat, which are due to the automatic rhythmic contractile
power of the heart muscle itself and to the peristaltic contractiori wave
which proceeds from sinus venosus to bulbus arteriosus and from
muscle fiber to muscle fiber’' (Garrison). Much of this may be deduced
from Harvey’s observations in this Chapter. Gaskell’s studies were
extended by T. W. Engelmann (1843—1909). They gave a new inter-
pretation to the classical experiments of H. Stannius (1808-1883) who
showed (Muller’s Arch.‚ 1852, 163) that a ligature around the sino-
auricularjunction would stop the beart, while a second ligature around
the auricular-ventricular groove would be followed by slow ventricula}-
beats. W. His, Jr., in 1893, found a thin strip of muscle between the
auricles and ventricles, which according to Gaskell‘s ideas, serves
as the conducting medium for the contractile impulses between auricles
and ventricles. The clinical significance ofheart-block or Stokes-Adams
disease was first emphasized by R. Adams (1791—1875) in the Dublin
Hospital Reports 4: 396, 1827, and by W. Stokes (1804-1878) in the
Dublin Quarterly Journal of Medical Science, 2: 73, 1846. The clinical
study of these phenomena has been greatly facilitated by electrocardio-

graphic methods developed chiefly by W. Einthoven (K. Acad. Amster.
Proc. Sect. Sc„ 6: 107, 1903).
