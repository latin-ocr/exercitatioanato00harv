AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

so nicely united that one cannot perceive any
crack along their junction. On the other hand,
they yield to a probe introduced from without
inwards and are easily released in the manner of
flood-gates opposing a river How. So they inter-
cept, and when tightly closed, completely prevent
in many places a How of blood back from the heart
and vena cava. They are so constituted that they
can never permit blood to move in the veins from,
the heart upwards to the head, downwards toward
the feet, or sidewise to the arms. They oppose any
movement of blood from the larger veins toward
the smaller ones, but they favor and facilitate
a free and open route starting from the small veins
and ending in the larger ones.

This fact may be more clearly shown by tying off
an arm of a subject as if for blood-letting (A, A,
fig. 1). There will appear at intervals (especially
in rustics) knots, or swellings, like nodules (B, C,
D, E, F), not only where there is branching (E, F),
but also where none occurs (C, D). These are caused
by the valves, appearing thus on the surface of the
hand and arm. If you will clear the blood away from
a nodule or valve by pressing a thumb or finger
below it (H, fig. 2), you will see that nothing can
flow back, being entirely prevented by the valve,
and that the part of the vein between the swelling
and the finger (H, O, fig. 2), disappears, while
above the swelling or valve it is well distended
(O, G). Keeping the vein thus empty of blood, if
