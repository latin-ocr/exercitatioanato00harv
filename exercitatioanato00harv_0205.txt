CHAPTER XIV

Conclusion of the Demonstration of the Circu-

lation os the Blood

·-·w—-o>e<e>—·4·-

RIEFLY let me now sum up and propose
generally my idea of the circulation of the
blood.

It has been shown by reason and experiment that
blood by the beat of the ventricles flows through
the lungs and heart and is pumped to the whole
body. There it passes through pores in the flesh
into the veins through which it returns from the
periphery everywhere to the center, from the smaller
veins into the larger ones, finally coming to the
vena cava and right auricle. This occurs in such
an amount, with such an outflow through the
arteries, and such a reflux through the veins‚
that it cannot be supplied by the food consumed.
It is also much more than is needed for nutrition.
It must therefore be concluded that the blood in
the animal body moves around in a circle continu-
oust, and that the action or function of the heart
is to accomplish this by pumping. This is the only
reason for the motion and beat of the heart.
