MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

Besides this I have sometimes noticed‚ after the
heart and even the right auricle had completely
stopped beating, that a slight motion or palpitation
remained in the blood in the right auricle‚ as long
as it seemed imbued with heat and spirit.

Something similar is very apparent in embryology,
as may be seen during the first seven days of the
hatching of a hen's egg. First, before anything else,
a drop of blood appears, which throbs, as Aristotle
had noted. From this, with increasing growth and
formation of the chick, the auricles of the heart are
made, in the pulsations of which there is continual
evidence of life. After a few more days, when the
body is outlined, the rest of the heart is made, but for
some time it remains pale and bloodless like the rest
of the body, and does not throb. I have seen a
similar condition in a human embryo about the
beginning of the third month, the ventricles being
pale and bloodless, but the auricles containing some
purple blood. In the egg, when the fetus forms and
develops‚ the heart grows also and acquires ven tricles‚
with which blood is received and transmitted.

&Vhoever examines this matter closely will not
say that the heart entirely is the first to live and the
last to die, but rather the auricles (or that part
corresponding to the auricles in serpents‚ fishes‚
and such animals) which live before the rest of the
heart, and die after it.

I should say rather that the blood itself or spirit
has in it an obscure throbbing which it seems to hold
