HARVEY'S Fmsr Nori-3 ON ‘ri-u·-⁴ CIRCULAnoN

This is the right hand page 80 of Harvey's Prelectiones Anatomiae
Universalis‚ his 1616 Lecture Notes‚ discovered in the British Museum
and published in 1886. It reads as follows:

WH constat per fabricam cordis sanguinem
per pulmones in Aortam perpetuo
transferri, as by two clacks of a
water bellows to rayse water
constat per ligaturam transitum sanguinis
ab arterijs ad venas
vnde Δ perpetuum sanguinis motum
in circulo fieri pulsu cordis
An? hoc gratia Nutritionis
an magis Conservationis sanguinis
et Membrorum per Infusionem calidam
vicissimque sanguis calefaciens
membra frigifactum a Corde

Calefit
One may freely translate these rough notes:

WH demonstrates by the structure of the heart that blood is continually passed
through the lungs into the aorra, as by two clacks ofa water bellows to raise water. The
passage of blood from arteries to veins is shown by means of a ligature. So it is proved
that a continual movement of the blood in a circle is caused by the beat of the heart.
Is this for the sake of nourishing or the better preservation of the blood and parts of tlie
body by infusion of heat, the blood alternately being cooled, by hearing these parts, and
warmed, by the heart?
