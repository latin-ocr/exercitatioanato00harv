AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

and the whole genus of zoophytes or plant-animals
have no heart, for the whole body functions as a
heart, and the animal itself is a heart.

In almost the entire family of insects we cannot
clearly discern a heart because of the smallness of
the body. In bees, flies, hornets, and the like, one
can see with a magnifying glass something pulsate.
Likewise in lice, in which, since they are translucent,
you can easily watch, with a magnifying glass² for
enlarging, the passage of food like a black spot
through the intestines.

In bloodless and colder animals as snails, shrimps,
and shell-fish there is a pulsating place like a vesicle
or auricle without a heart. This may be seen beating
and contracting, slowly indeed, and only in the sum-

In these this part is fashioned because there

on account of the variety of separate organs or the
denseness of their substance. But the beats are
seldom and sometimes entirely fail through cold. This
is appropriate to their doubtful nature as they
sometimes seem living, sometimes dying, some-
times showing the vitality of animals, sometimes of
