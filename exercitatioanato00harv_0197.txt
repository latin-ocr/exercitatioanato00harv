ΜΟΤΙΟΝ OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

on the inner lining of these vessels. They are placed
differently in different individuals, but are attached
to the sides of the veins‚ and they are directed
upwards toward the main venous trunks. As there
are usually two together, they face and touch each
other, and their edges are so apt to join or close
that they prevent anything from passing from the
main trunks or larger veins to the smaller branches.
They are so arranged that the horns of one set are
opposite the hollow part of the preceding set, and
so on alternately.

The discoverer of these valves and his followers
did not rightly appreciate their function. It is
not to prevent blood from falling by its weight into
areas lower down, for there are some in the jugulat
vein which are directed downwards, and which prevent
blood from being carried upwards. They are thus
not always looking upwards‚ but more correctly,
always towards the main venous trunks and the

 

which gave such glory to Padua where they taught. Harvey studied
under Fabricius from 1598 to 1602. Vesalius was a pupil of J. Sylvius
(1478-1555) at Paris.

It is likely that G. Canano (1515-1578) first described the valves
in the veins. C. Estienne (d. 1564) had observed valves in the portal
veins (not present in man) in 1538, and J. Sylvius commented on
them posthumously. The first published drawings of venons valves
were by S. Alberti‚ De Valvulis, 1585, who acknowledged indebted-
ness to Fabricius. The latter demonstrated them publicly in 1579
and published his De venarum osteolis in 1603. Harvey employed to
make his two plates the same Frankfort craftsman who had made
the copper-plates for the 1624 edition of Fabricius (H. Cushing and
E. C. Streeter, Monumenta Medica, IV, Canano, Florence‚ 1925).
