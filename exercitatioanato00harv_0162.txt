AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

impossible and unbelievable. They are of that class
of men, as I reply with the poet, who promptly agree
or disagree, according to their whim, fearful when
wanted, bold when there is no need.

The substance of the liver and also of the kidney
is very dense, but that of the lung is much looser, and
in comparison with the liver and kidney is spongy.²

There is no propulsive force in the liver, but in the
lung the blood is pushed along by the beat of the
right ventricle of the beart, which must distend the
vessels and pores of the lung. Again, as Galen in-
dicates (De Usu Part„ cap. Io), the continual rising
and falling of the lungs in respiration must open and
close the vessels and porosities, as in a sponge or
thing of similar structure when it is compressed and
allowed to expand.³ The liver, however, is quiet,
it never seems to expand or contract.

 

² This later developed into the question of an “open'' or a “closed''
circulation through an organ. The microscopic structure of the in-
ternal organs, which gives the clue to their architecture and functional
mechanism, was first investigated by Marcello Malpighi (1628-1694),
the brilliant Italian scientist. In his De pulmonibus (1661) he gave
the first clear conception of the structure of the lung, and completed
Harvey's demonstration (announced the year of his birth) by proving
the capillary anastomoses between arteries and veins. In his De
Viscerum structura (1666) he outlined the structure of the livet,
spleen, and kidney. The best modern work on the architecture of
the kidney has been done by J. Henle (1809-1885), of the liver by
F. P. Mall (1862-1917), and of the lung by W. S. Miller (1858 ).
The question of an open versus a closed circulation through an organ
seems to be settled in favor of the latter.

³ Respiration does considerably influence blood-pressure. It is
generally agreed that blood-pressure rises during inspiration and falls
during expiration. For a discussion of the factors involved, see: R.
