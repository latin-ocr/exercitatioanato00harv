ΜΟΤΙΟΝ OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

In the more perfect warm-blooded adult animals,
as man, the blood passos from the right ventricle of
the heart through the pulmonary artery to the lungs,
from there through the pulmonary vein into the left
auricle, and then into the left ventricle. First I
shall show how this may be so, and then that it is so.
