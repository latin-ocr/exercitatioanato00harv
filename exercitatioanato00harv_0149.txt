MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

peculiar side-wise turning toward the right ventricle
as if it twists slightly on itself in performing its work.
It is easy to see when a horse drinks that water is
drawn in and passed to the stomach with each gulp,
the movement making a sound‚ and the pulsation
may be heard and felt. So it is with each move-
ment of the heart when a portion of the blood
is transferred from the veins to the arteries‚ that a
pulse is made which may be heard in the chest.²

The motion of the heart, then, is of this general
type. The chief function of the heart is the trans-
mission and pumping of the blood through the arteries
to the extremities of the body. Thus the pulse which
we feel in the arteries is nothing else than the impact
of blood from the heart,

Whether or not the heart, besides transferring,
distributing and giving motion to the blood, adds
anything else to it, as heat‚ spirits, or perfection, may
be discussed later and determined on other grounds.
It is enough now to have shown that during the heart
beat the blood is transferred through the ventricles
from the veins to the arteries‚ and distributed to
the whole body.

This much may be generally admitted on the basis
of the structure of the heart and the position and

 

² One of the first observations of heart-sounds. An interpretation
of their significance together with clinical application was made by
R.-T.-H. Laennec (1781—1826) in his epochal Traite de l’auscultation
mediate (1819). See W. H. Howell’s Physiology‚ 10th Ed., Phila.‚
1927, p. 557. For a history of knowledge of heart sounds, Garrison
refers to G. Joseph, Janus, 2: 1, 345, 565, 1853.
