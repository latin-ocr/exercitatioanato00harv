'¹ AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ THE

bulge outward‚ the cavities dilate, the ventricles
take the shape of cupping glasses, and suck the
blood into them. But all the fibers constrict the
heart at the same time that they make it tense, thus
thickening the walls and substance rather than
enlarging the ventricles. As the fibers stretch from
the apex to the base of the heart, drawing the apex
toward the base, they do not tend to make the walls
bulge outwards‚ but rather the reverse, for all fibers
spirally arranged become straight on contraction.
This is true of all muscular fibers. When they con-
tract they shorten longitudinally and distend side-
wise as they thicken‚ as noted in the bellies of
muscles generally. To this may be added that the
ventricles are not constricted only by virtue of the
direction and thickening of their walls. The walls
contain solely circular fibers, but there are also
bands containing only straight fibers, which are
noted in the ventricles of larger animals and which
are called nerves by Aristotle.⁵ When they contract
together an excellent system is present to pull the
internal surfaces closely together, as with cords, in
order to eject the blood with greater force.

 

⁵ The inside walls of the ventricles are ridged with many projecting
bands of muscle tissue, arranged as (1) separate threads stretched
across the cavity‚ the moderator bands especially noted in the right
ventricle3 (2) columns on the walls, the columnae carneae, which are
probably referred to here, and (3) small elevations on the walls,
papillary muscles, which are prolonged in the chordae tendineae extend-
ing to the valves. The latter probably aid in closing more exactly the
valve flaps. See R. Burton-Opitz’s Physiology, Phila. and London,
