MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

no one need doubt further, for if the cavity of the
ventricle be cut into, the blood contained therein
will be forcibly squirted out when the heart is tense
with each movement or beat.

The following things take place, then, simul-
taneously: the contractiori of the heart; the beat
at the apex against the chest‚ which may be felt
outside3 the thickening of the walls: and the forcible
ejection of the blood it contains by the constriction
of the ventricles.

So the opposite of the commonly received opinion
seems true. Instead of the heart opening its ven-
tricles and filling with blood at the moment it strikes
the chest and its beat is felt on the outside, the
contrary takes place so that the heart while con-
tracting empties. Therefore the motion commonly
thought the diastole of the heart is really the systole,
and the significant movement of the heart is not the
diastole but the systole. The heart does not act
in diastole but in systole for only when it contracts
is it active.

It is not to be admitted that the heart moves only
in the direction of its straight fibers. The great
Vesalius, in support of this idea, speaks of a bundle
of willow-twigs bound in a pyramid.4 It is implied
that as the apex is drawn to the base, the sides

Basle, 1543, Lib. 6, Cap. [0, p. 587. It is interesting to note how
Vesalius described fairly well the gross structures of the heart, and then
fitted them as best he could into the Galenical system.
