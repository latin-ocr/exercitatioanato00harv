MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

beats of the artery you will see the hand become
impacted and gorged with a great amount of blood
“drawn'' by this medium tight ligature, but with-
out pain, heat, horror of a vacuum or any other
cause so far proposed.

If one will place a finger on the artery as it beats
at the edge of the bandage, the blood may be felt
to How under it at the moment of loosening. The
subject, also, on whose arm the experiment is made,
clearly feels‚ as the ligature is slackened, warmth
and blood pulsing through, as though an obstacle
has been removed. And he is conscious of it follow-
ing the artery and diffusing through the hand, as
it warms and swells.

In the case of the tight bandage, the artery is
distended and pulsates above it, not below; in the
mediumly tight one, however, the veins become
turgid and the arteries shrink below the ligature,
never above it. Indeed, in this case, unless you
compress these swollen veins very strongly, you
will scarcely be able to force any blood above the
ligature or cause the veins there to be filled.

From these facts any careful observer may easily
understand that blood enters a limb through the
arteries. A tight bandage about them “draws’'
nothing, the hand keeps its color, nothing fiows
into it, neither is it distended. With a little slacken-
ing, as in a mediumly tight ligature, it is clear that
the blood is instantly and strongly forced in, and
the hand made to swell. When they pulsate, blood
