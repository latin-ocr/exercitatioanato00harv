MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

Meanwhile I know and state to all that the blood
is transmitted sometimes in a larger amount, other
times in a smaller, and that the blood circulates
sometimes rapidly‚ sometimes slowly, according
to temperament, age, external or internal causes,
normal or abnormal factors, sleep, rest, food‚ ex-
ercise, mental condition, and such like.

But suppose even the smallest amount of blood
be transmitted through the lungs and heart at a
single beat, a greater quantity would eventually be
pumped into the arteries and the body than could be
furnished by the food consumed,³ unless by constantly
making a circuit and returning.

 

amount in arterial blood. The minute-volume absorbed divided by
the arterial concentration gives the volume flow per minute through
the lungs, which divided by the pulse-rate gives the “stroke-volume'’
of the heart. See also the Lancet, 2: 1265 and 1317, Dec. 19 and 26,
1925. The problem may also be solved in a relatively simple mechani
cal way, by x-ray pictures of the heart at systole and diastole (W. J
Meek and J. A. E. Eyster‚ Amer. J. Roentgenol., 7: 471, 19203 Amet.
J. Physiol., 63: 400, 1923; P. Hodges and J. Eyster‚ Amer. J. Roent-
genol., 12: 252, 1924). The next paragraph is an astonishing asser-
tion to make, and we are left to wonder how much of our supposed
recent knowledge of the physiology and pathology of the circulation
Harvey anticipated. The question regarding ventricular emptying,
of fundamental importance in cardiac pathology, is implied in the
second paragraph back, where it is indicated that there may be
variations in the relative quantities expelled.

³ This was the crux of the argument to Harvey, since the Galenists
insisted that blood was formed in the liver (“natural spirits‘') from
the food consumed, and distributed by the veins to nourish the parts
of the body according to their needs. Hence the emphasis placed by
Harvey in proving, by most conservative estimates, that the heart
pumps in a relatively short time more blood than is needed for nutri-
tion οι· than food can supply, more in fact than the whole weight of
the man or animal. Obviously it must be the same blood going around
