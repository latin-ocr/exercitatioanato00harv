1 lay my work before the public at home, or send it beyond seas
for impression, unless I had first proposed its subject to you,
had confirmed its conclusions by ocular demonstrations in your
presence, had replied to your doubts and objections, and secured
the assent and support of our distinguished President. For Ι
was most intimately persuaded, that if Ι could make good my
proposition before you and our College, illustrious by its numer-
ous body of learned individuals, I had less to fear from others;
I even ventured to hope that I should have the comfort of
finding all that you had granted me in your sheer love of truth,
conceded by others who were philosophers like yourselves. For
true philosophers, who are only eager for truth and knowledge,
never regard themselves as already so thoroughly informed‚ but

infinitely less than all that still remains unknown; nor do
philosophers pin their faith to others' precepts in such wise that
they lose their liberty, and cease to give credence to the con-

fealty to their mistress Antiquity, that they openly, and in
sight of all, deny and desert their friend Truth. But even as
they see that the credulous and vain are disposed at the first
blush to accept and to believe everything that is proposed to
them, so do they observe that the dull and unintellectual are
indisposed to see what lies before their eyes, and even to deny
the light of the noonday sun. They teach us in our course of
philosophy as sedulously to avoid the fables of the poets and
the sancies of the vulgar, as the false conclusions of the sceptics.
And then the studious, and good, and true, never suffer their
minds to be warped by the passions of hatred and envy, which
unfit men duly to weigh the arguments that are advanced in
behalf of truth, or to appreciate the proposition that is even
