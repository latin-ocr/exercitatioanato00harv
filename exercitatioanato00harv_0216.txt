MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

the upper part of the splenic branch leading to the
pancreas arise the posterior coronary, gastric, and
gastroepiploic veins‚ all of which are spread in many
branches on the stomach, like the mesenterics on
the intestines. Likewise, into the lower part of this
splenic vessel empty the hemorrhoidal veins from
the colon and rectum. Through both these venous
systems returning blood is poured into the splenic
branch, carrying with it from the stomach a crude
watery juice not completely chylified‚ and from
the feces a thick earthy material. Both these are
appropriately tempered by natural mixture, al-
though difficultly concocted alone, because of op-
posite defects. Then, diluted by a large amount
of warm blood flowing through the spleen from
its large artery‚ the mixture enters the portal of
the liver in a better state of preparation. The de-
fects of either extreme are made up and compensated
by this arrangement of the veins.
