AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ THE

the lungs and right cavity of the heart. Likewise it
sends spiritous blood into the aorta. From this it
separates waste-vapors which are released to the
lung by the pulmonary artery. From the lung
spirits are obtained for the aorta. How is this separa-
tion made? How do spirits and waste-vapors pass
here and there without mixture or confusion? If
the rnitral valves⁸ do not stop the passage of waste
vapor to the lungs, how do they stop the escape of
air? How do the semilunars prevent the return of
spirits from the aorta following cardiac diastole?
Above all, how can it be said that the pulmonary
vein distributes the spiritous blood from the left
ventricle to the lungs without hindrance from the
mitral valves, having asserted that air enters the
left ventricle from the lungs by this same vessel
and is prevented from going back to the lungs by
these same mitrals? Good God! How do the mitral
valves prevent escape of air and not of blood?

 

⁸ These are referred to as tricuspides mitrale-c, and later in this same
paragraph simply as tricuspides. The tricuspids and mitral valves are
described in Chapter XVII, but not specifically differentiated by name.
The specific terminology became established within the next century.-
Thus William Cheselden (1688—1752), in his Anatomy qf the Human
Body, 1713, says, “Over the entrance of the auricles in each ventricle,
are placed valves to hinder a return of blood when the heart contracts.
Those in the right ventricle are named Tricuspides‚ those in the left
Mitrales.'' Harvey was not the first to use the terrn '‘mitral.” Ve-
salius (1 514—1564) was apparently the first to compare the left auriculo-
ventricular valves to an episcopal miter. The best publication on
the heart after Harvey’s is Richard Lower’s (1631-1690) Tractatus de
Corde (1669). In this he specifically and consistently refers to the
“mitral valves.''
