MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

as in the right, why say they are for the purpose of
impeding the escape and reflux of spirits in the left
ventricle but of blood in the right? The same ar-
rangement cannot be suited to hinder in a similar
way blood as well as spirits.

3. When the openings and vessels mutually cor-
respond in size, as is clear in the pulmonary artery
and pulmonary vein,⁷ why should one have a par-
ticular function, viz., of nourishing the lungs, but
the other a general function?

4. How is it possible (as Realdus Columbus
notes) that so much blood is needed for the nourish-
ment of the lungs, with the pulmonary artery lead—
ing to them exceeding in size both iliae veins?

5. Again I ask, when the lungs are so near, the
blood vessel to them of such size, and themselves in
continual motion, what is the object of the beat
of the right ventricle? And why did Nature have
to add this other ventricle to the heart for the sake
of nourishing the lungs?

It is said that the left ventricle draws material
for forming spirits, namely air and blood, from

 

⁷ These terms in the Latin are confusing. The pulmonary artery
was called vena arteriosa, “the vein similar to an artery.'' A “vein,'’
because it carried “natural spirits” to nourish the lung, but its structure
was recognized to be like that of the aorta‚ or great artery. The
pulmonary vein was called arteria venosa, “the artery similar to a
vein.'’ An “artery'’ because it carried “vital spirits” (and many other
things, as Harvey shows, in opposite directionsl), but its structure was
admittedly venous. It is not always easy to keep these terms straight.
Even Dr. Robert Willis, whose splendid translation of Harvey for the
Sydenham Society (1847) is the standard English version, slipped.
