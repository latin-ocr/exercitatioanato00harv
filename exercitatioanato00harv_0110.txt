AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

wound in two opposite directions. In cutting open
an artery it is equally clear that the blood escapes in
one continuous direction and that no air either goes
in or comes out.

If the pulsations of the arteries cool and purify
the various portions of the body as the lungs do the
heart, how, as is commonly said, do the arteries
carry from the heart to the separate parts the vital
blood stuffed with vital spirits, which keep up the
heat of these parts, nourish them in sleep, and re-
store them in exhaustion? How, if the arteries be
tied off, do the parts at once become not only torpid‚
cold, and pale, but even cease to be nourished‚
unless it be as Galen says that they have been de-
prived of that heat which flowed through them from
the heart? So it would seem that the arteries carry
heat to the parts instead of cooling them.

Now, how may the diastole draw spirits from the
heart to warm the parts at the same time from the
outside to cool them? Further‚ although some
state that the lungs, arteries, and heart have the
same function, they also say that the heart is the
factory of the spirits and that the arteries contain
and transmit them, denying‚ contrary to the opinion
of Columbus,3 that the lungs either make or contain

unscholarly, and unscrupulous man, pupil of Vesalius, and Professor
of Anatomy at Rome. In his De Re Anatomica (1559), he correctly
described the pulmonary circulation‚ but failed to realize the signifi-
cance ofwhat he did. He made a distinct advance over the Galenists,
however, in thinking that blood was rendered “spiritous” by air in
