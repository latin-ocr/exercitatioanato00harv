MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

may be found why Nature, in larger adult animals,
filters the blood through the lungs instead of choosing
a direct path. No other way seems possible. It may
be the larger, more perfect animals are warmer and
when full grown their greater heat is thus more
easily damped. For this reason the blood may go
through the lungs, to be cooled by the inspired air
and saved from boiling and extinction.³ There may
be other reasons. To discuss and argue these points
would be to speculate on the function of the lungs.
Ι have made many observations on this matter, on
ventilation‚ and on the necessity and use of air, as
well as on the various organs in animals concerned
in these matters. Nevertheless I shall leave these
things to be more conveniently discussed in a separate
tract lest I seem to wander too far from the propo-
sition of the motion and function of the beart, and
to confuse the question. Returning to our present
concern, I shall go on with my demonstration.

 

1912, p. 50.) He may have used opium preparations to give analgesia
but there is no evidence favoring this view. It is not likely that he
performed many experiments on higher animals, except such as were
caught wounded in the King's hunts. R. Hannah has painted such a
scene, where Harvey is demonstrating to Charles the heart of a deer
slain in the chase.

³ The innate heat was supposed to reside in the blood, and the older
theories on the heart beat and movcment of the blood included the
idea that the blood boiled up in the beart, and “boiled over'’ into the
vessels, thus causing the heart beat and pulse. The function of respira-
tion was thus to cool the heart. It is peculiar that Harvey should have
permitted himself to utter this speculation when he so sarcastically
attacked the current ideas on respiration and the cooling of the blood
in the introduction.
