MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

But to go on with our subject, on the function of
the auricles in filling the ventricles with blood, it may
be observed that the thicker and denser the walls of
the heart itself‚ the more fibrous and muscular are
the auricles, and the reverse. In some animals the
auricle appears to be a bloody membranous sac, as in
fishes, where it is so delicate and ample that it seems
to float above the heart. In other fishes as the carp,
and barbel, in which this vesicle is a little more
fleshy, it bears a striking resemblance to lungs.

In some men of heavier and huskier build, the
right auricle is so robust and so well braced inside by
bands and various connecting fibers that it approxi-
mates in strength the ventricle of other subjects. I
marvel that there is such variation in this in different
men.

It is noteworthy that the auricles are dispropor-
tionately large in the fetus, because they are present
before the rest of the heart is made or can take up its
function, so that, as shown before, they assume the
duty of the whole heart.

My observations previously referred to on the
development of the fetus, and which Aristotle con-
firms in regard to the egg, throw great light on this
matter. While the fetus is till soft like a worm, or,
as is said, in the milk,ll there is a single bloody spot,
or pulsating sac, as if a part of the umbilical vein

wretched Longhine edition, Bonn, 1697, rendered vermicules as ven-
tricules, and lacte as lucte!
