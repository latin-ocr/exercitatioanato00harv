they were forced to say that blood oozed through the
septum of the heart from the right ventricle to the

there will be no more difficulty in agreeing with what
Ι suggest about the beat of the heart and arteries,
the transfer of blood from veins to arteries and its
distribution to the body through the arteries.

lation has passed it by, when the context alone should raise a doubt.
The text reads arteriam venosam, the artery like unto a vein, or the
pulmonary vein.
