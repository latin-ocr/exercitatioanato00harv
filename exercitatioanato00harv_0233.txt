MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

the left. The lungs are relatively softer in texture
than the flesh and bulk of the body in the same degree
that the walls of the pulmonary artery differ from
those of the aorta. This general proportion holds
quite universally. The stronger, more muscular, and
more substantial the build of men, the thicker,
heavier, more powerful and fibrous the heart, and the
auricles and arteries are proportionally increased in
thickness, strength, and all other respects.

On the other hand, in fish, birds, serpentsâ€š and
other such families of animals, the ventricles of the
heart are smooth inside, without villi or valves. The
walls are thinner and the arteries scarcely differ from
the veins in thickness of tunics.

Further, why do the lungs have such large vesseIS,
veins as well as arteries, for the trunk of the pul-
monary veins exceeds both crurals and jugulam, and
why are they filled with so much blood? We know by
experience in autopsies and the advice of Aristode,
not to be deceived by the appearance of such animals
as we encounter in dissection which have been bled
to death. The reason is that the source and store-
house of the blood, and the place for its perfecting, is
in the lungs and heart.

Similarly, why do we find the pulmonary vein and
left ventricle in dissections so full of the same black
clotted blood which fills the right ventricle and pul-
monary artery? Because blood continually traverses
the lungs from the right side of the heart to the left.

Finally, why has the so-called vena arteriosa the
