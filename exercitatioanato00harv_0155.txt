MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

In the fetus a lateral anastomosis joins the vena
cava to the pulmonary vein. This is located before
the vena cava opens into the right ventricle of the
heart, or gives off the coronary vein, just above its
exit from the liver. This is a good-sized oval-shaped
hole opening a passage from the vena cava to the
pulmonary vein, so that blood may freely fiow from
the one to the other, then into the left auricle of the
heart, and then to the left ventricle. In this foramen
wale, there is a thin tough membrane, larger than
the opening, hanging like a cover from the pulmonary
vein side. In the adult this blocks the foramen, and
adhering on all sides, finally closes and obliterates it.
In the fetus, however, this membrane hangs loosely‚
opening an easy way to the lungs and heart for the
blood flowing from the vena cava, but at the same
time blocking any passage back into that vein. In
the embry0‚ one may conclude then that blood con-
tinually passes through this foramen from the vena
cava to the pulmonary vein, and then into the left
ventricle of the heart. After making this passage,
it can not regurgitate.

Another junction is by the pulmonary artery where
it divides into two branches after leaving the right
ventricle. It is like a third trunk added to these two,
a sort of arterial canal passing obliquely toward
and perforating the aorta. Thus in dissecting a
human embryo it appears as though there were two
aortae or roots of the great artery rising from the
heart.
