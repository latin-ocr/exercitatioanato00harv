AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ THE

heart. Others as well as myself have sometimes
found them in the milky veins2 and in the venous
branches of the mesentery directed towards the
vena cava and portal vein. To this may be added
that there are none in the arteries‚ and that one
may note that dogs, oxen, and all such animals
have valves at the branches of the crural veins
at the top of the sacrum, and in branches from the
hauncheS, in which no such weight effect of an erect
stature is to be feared.

Nor, as some say, are the valves in the jugular
veins to prevent apoplexy, since the head is more
likely to be influenced by what flows into it through
the carotid arteries.3 Nor are they present to keep
blood in the smaller branches, not permitting it to
flow entirely into the larger more open trunks,

 

² Does Harvey mean the lacteals? The Galenical error, to which
Harvey subscribed, that the veins of the mesentery carried chyle to
the liver, was cleared up by G. Aselli (1581-1626) who discovered
the lacteals (De lactibus, Milan, 1627), by J. Pecquet (1622-1674)
who showed their passage to the thoracic duct and then to the sub-
clavian vein (Experimenta nova, Paris, 1651), and by O. Rudbeck
(1639—1702) and T. Bartholin (1616—1680) who discovered the in-
testinal lymphatics and their connection with the thoracic duct.
Pecquet’s work contained a carefully devised proof of Harvey's
doctrine. On April 28, 1652, Harvey wrote a letter to Dr. R. Morison
of Paris (see Willis’s translation of Harvey's works, Sydenham
Society, 1847, p. 604) in which he discussed Pecquet's contribution.
His characteristic conservatism prevented him from accepting the
discovery, although it offered a demonstrable explanation of an un-
satisfactory portion of his own.

³An idea partially expressed in their very name, “the arteries
of sleep.’' This name may have developed from the early observation
(used for anesthetic purposes by the Assyrians) that pressure on these
vessels might be followed by fainting.
