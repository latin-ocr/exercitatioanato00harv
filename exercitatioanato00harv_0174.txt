AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

diastole, contains two or three ounces, or only an
ounce and a half. In a cadaver I have found it
holding more than three ounces. Likewise let us
consider how much less the ventricle contains when
the heart contracts or how much blood it forces
into the aorta with each contraction, for, during
systole, everyone will admit something is always
forced out, as shown in Chapter III, and apparent
from the structure of the valves. As a reasonable
conjecture suppose a fourth, fifth, sixth, or even
an eighth part is passed into the arteries. Then
we may suppose in man that a single heart beat
would force out either a half ounce, three drams,
or even one drarn of blood, which because of the
valvular block could not How back that way into
the heart.

The heart makes more than a thousand beats in
a half hour, in some two, three, or even four thou-
sand. Multiplying by the drams, there will be in
half an hour either 3,ooo drams, 2,ooo drams, five
hundred ounces, or some other such proportionate
amount of blood forced into the arteries by the
heart, but always a greater quantity than is pres-
ent in the whole body. Likewise in a sheep or dog,
suppose one scruple goes out with each stroke of
the heart, then in half an hour 1,ooo scruples or
about three and a half pounds of blood1 would be
