MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

the right side of the heart to the left. Both ventri-
cles equally have the same function of transferring
blood from the vena cava to the aorta through the
foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus, and of
pumping it to the whole body, whence their struc-
tural equality.

However, when the lungs are used and it is time
for the passages spoken of to be closed, then these
differences in the ventricles begin to appear, since
the right pumps only through the lungs, but the
lef t through the whole body.

There are also so-called braces in the heart, many
fleshy and fibrous bands, which Aristotle calls
nerves (De. Respirat. & De Part. Animal„ Lib. 3).
They are stretched partly from place to place, and
partly in the walls and septum, where they form
little pits. Little muscles are concealed in these
furrows which are added to assist in a more power-
ful contraction of the heart and a more vigorous
expulsion of blood.⁵ Like the elever and elaborate
arrangement of ropes on a ship‚ they help the heart
to contract in every direction, driving blood more
fully and forcibly from the ventricles.

It may be shown, however, that some animals
have less than others, that in all animals with them,
they are more numerous and stronger in the left
than in the right ventricle, and in some animals where

 

⁶ These papillary muscles, elongated into the chordae tendinae which
extend to the valves, seem to aid in closing the valves more exactly.
