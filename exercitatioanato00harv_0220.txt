AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ THE

it is convenient for these animals to have lungs
and another ventricle to send nouishment through
these lungs.

Wherever there are lungs there are two ventricles
in the heart, a right and left, and wherever there
is a right there is also a left, but not the reverse.
I call that the left ventricle which is distinguished
by function, not position, the one namely that sends
blood to the whole body, not merely to the lungs.
This left ventricle seems to comprise the real heart.
It is medianly placed, marked with deeper furrows,
and made with greater care, so that the heart seems
to have been formed for the sake of the left ventricle.
The right ventricle is a sort of servant to the left,
it does not reach to the apex, its walls are three-
fold thinner, and it is somehow joined on to the
left, as Aristotle says. Its capacity indeed is greater
since it not only furnishes material to the left but
also nourishment to the lungs.

It is noteworthy that this is otherwise in the
embryo, where there is no such difference between
the ventricles. As in the double kernels of a nut,
they about equal each other, and the tip of the
right reaches the apex of the left, so that the heart
appears as a double-pointed cone. Here, as I have
said, blood does not pass through the lungs from

tradictions against which he is so bitter in the Introduction. In the
present instance, for example, it was also taught that respIration
existed for cooling the heart, to keep the blood from boiling and ex-
tinction (Note 3, Chapter VI).
