The ,Mation and Circulation of the Blood is
Establislzed by What is Displayed in
the Heart and Elsewhere by

Anatomical Investigation

DO not find the heart a separate and distinct

organ in all animals. Some, called plant-animals,
have no heart at all. These animals are colder, have
little bulk, are soster, and of uniform structure,
such as grubs, worms‚ and many which come from
decayed material and do not preserve their species.1
These need no heart to impel nourishment to their
extremities‚ for their bodies are uniform and they
have no separate members. By the contraction and
relaxation of the whole body they take up and move,
expel and remove aliment. Oysters, mussels, sponges

 

¹ Harvey really says “generated from decayed material.'' This
idea of spontaneous generatim, current from the beginning of philoso-
phical speculati0n‚ received its first serious blow from Francesco
Redi (1626-1694) in his Experientia circa generationem insectorum,
Amsterdam, 1671. The final blow, covering microscopie forms of
life, was given by L. Pasteur (1822-1895). In his De generatione
animalium, 1651, Harvey maintained the theory that the organism
is not preformed in the ovum, but that it gradually evolves by growth
and union of its parts. This, as Garrison says, “subverted the ancient
concept that life is engendered out of corruption (or putrefaction).'’
