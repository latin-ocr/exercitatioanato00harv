AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

they are present in the left, none are found in the
right chamber. In man there are more in the left
than in the right ventricle, and more in the ventricles
than in the auricles, and in some subjects it seems
there are none in the auricles. In large, muscular,
peasant-type individuals there are many, in more
slender frames, and in women, few.

In some animals the ventricles of the heart are
smooth inside, entirely without fibers or bands.
In almost all small birds, serpents, frogs, turtles,
and such like, and in most all fishes, neither fibers,
or so-called nerves, nor tricuspid valves are found
in the ventricles.

In some animals the right ventricle is smooth
inside while the left has these fibrous bands, as in
the goose, swan, and heavier birds. The reason is
the same here as elsewhere. Since the lungs are
spongy, loose, and soft, not so great a force is needed
to pump blood through them. Therefore the right
ventricle either has none of these fibers or they are
few and weak, not fleshy or muscular. Those of the
left ventricle, however, are stronger, more numerous,
and more muscular because this chamber needs
to be more powerful since it must propel blood
farther through the whole body. This is also why
the left ventricle is placed in the middle of the
heart‚ and has walls three times as thick and strong
as the right.

So all animals, man included, that have a stronger
and more sturdy frame, with large, brawny limbs
