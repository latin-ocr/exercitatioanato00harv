ΜΟΤῙΟΝ OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

it is more comparable, as Aristotle says, to adding
a single drop of water to a cask of wine, or the
reverse. Then the total is not a mixture, but re-
mains either wine or water. So in dissecting the
mesenteric veins, chyme and blood are not found
either separately or mixed, but only the same blood
in color and consistency as appears in the other
veins. Still, since there is some chyle or uncon-
cocted material, however small, in this, Nature has
interposed the liver, in whose winding passages it
delays and undergoes more change, lest coming too
quickly in the rough to the heart, it suppress vitality.

Hence there is almost no use for the liver in the
embryo. The umbilical vein clearly passes right
through the liver‚ with an opening or anastomosis
to the portal vein, so that fetal blood returning
from the intestines does not flow through the liver,
but mixed with maternal blood from the placenta
goes to the heart through this umbilical vein. So
in the development of the fetus, the liver is among
the last parts formed. In the human fetus we often
see all the organs fully marked out, even the genitals,
while there is still almost no trace of the liver. At
the time when all the organs, even the heart, appear
white, and there is no sign of redness anywhere ex-
cept in the veins, you will see nothing where the
liver should be except an irregular spot like blood
spilled out of a ruptured vein.

In the developing egg there are two umbilical
veins, one passing through the liver directly to the
