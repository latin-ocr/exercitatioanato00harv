Δ ΜΟΤΙΟΝ OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

doubts removed, and how much obscurity cleared
up by the truth and light here given.⁵ It opens
up a field so vast that were I to scan it further or
investigate it more fully this little effort would
swell to a huge volume which perhaps would take
more than my ability or span of life to finish.

In the following chapter, therefore, reference
will only be made to the functions and causes de-
rived from an anatomical study of the heart and
arteries, Even here I shall find much which may
be explained by my theory, and which in turn will
make it more clear. Above all, I wish to confirm and
illustrate it by anatomical reasoning.

There is one point, however, which might be
noted here, although it belongs more properly in
my discussion of the function of the spleen.⁶ From

 

⁵ Did Harvey mean this treatise to be a “preliminary communica-
tion ?” It seems doubtful that there would be much to add to what
is here written or to what may be inferred from it. Harvey probably
was honest in the remark here made,—he realized what still could
be done but was willing to let others take up the burden, while he
himself was anxious to let it drop.

⁵ This paragraph seems to have been another after-thought. If
Harvey ever wrote a discussion of the function of the spleen‚ it was
apparently lost with his other papers during the plunderings of the
Civil War. If this note is an example of the many observations Har-
vey felt could be made in the light of his doctrine, it would better
have been omitted. A typical Galenical argument, straining to find
the “design'’ in nature, this is the antithesis of most of the clear-cut
observations and explanations in this book. The majority of these
are directly in the modern spirit of simple description with an at-
tempted explanation of the mechanism involved. Harvey was in
fact among the first to emphasize the how in physiology, rather than
the more conceited and arrogant why.
