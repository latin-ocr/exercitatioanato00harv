MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

Further, if the pulmonary artery, a large vessel,
with heavy arterial walls, be destined for only the
single particular purpose of nourishing the lungs,
why should the pulmonary vein, scarcely of the
same size, with soft flabby venous walls, be supposed
to have three or four different uses? It is desired
that air pass through this vessel from the lungs to
the left ventricleâ€š likewise that waste vapors escape
by the same vessel from the heart to the lungs, and
that some of the spiritous blood from the heart be
distributed by it to keep the lungs alive.

To desire that waste vapors from the heart and
air to the heart be transmitted by this same conduit
is opposed to Nature which nowhere has made but
a single vessel or way for such contrary movements
and purposes.

If waste vapors and air come and go by this pas-
sage, as they do in the pulmonary bronchi, why do
we find neither air nor sooty vapors when we cut
open the pulmonary vein? Why do we always find
the pulmonary vein full of thick blood, never of air,
while in the lungs we note plenty of air?

If one repeats Galen's experiment of opening the
trachea of a living dog, forcing air into the lungs by
a bellows, and then firmly tying off the trachea, a
great abundance of air even out to the pleurae will
be found in the lungs on opening the chest. No air,
however, will be found in the pulmonary vein or in
the left ventricle of the heart. It certainly should
be if the heart drew in air from the lungs, or if the
