AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

Since the movements and structure of the heart
differ from those of the lungs, as those of the arteries
from those of the chest, separate functions or pur-
poses are likely. The pulsings and uses of the heart
as well as of the arteries are distinct from those
of the chest and lungs. If the pulse and respiration
have the same purpose, if the arteries in diastole
draw air into their cavities (as commonly said)
and in systole give off waste vapors by the same
pores in flesh and skin, and if also in the time be-
tween systole and diastole they contain air,1 in fact
containing at all times either air, spirits, or sooty
vapors, what may be answered to Galen? He de-
clared that the arteries by nature contain blood
and blood alone, neither air nor spirits, as may
easily be determined by experiments and explana-
'tions found in his report.

If in diastole the arteries are filled by air drawn
in, the greater the pulse the greater being the ¹amount
drawn in, then when the whole body is immersed
in a bath of oil or water, a previously strong pulse
should either become much weaker or slower, for
the bath surrounding the body will make it difficult
if not impossible for the air to enter the arteries.
Likewise, when all the arteries‚ the deep as well as

 

¹ The word fuligines is translated waste-vapors. The idea of this
supposed sooty material may have developed from the duskier hue of
venous blood. The intake and output of ait to and from the arteries
through pores in flesh and skin goes right back to Empedocles (5th
Cent. B.C.). Interesting that this should be involved in the first aspect
of current opinion about the heart and blood-vessels to be refuted by
Harvey.
