AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

the urine, garlic placed on the feet promotes ex-
pectoration, cordials invigorate, and so on.3 It is
not unreasonable to say that the veins take up
through their openings some of the things applied
externally and carry them in with the blood, not
unlike the way in which those in the mesentery
absorb chyle from the intestines, and carry it along
with blood to the liver.

Blood enters the mesentery through the coeliae,
and the superior and inferior mesenteric arteries‚
and passes to the intestines. From these, along
with chyle drawn in by the veins, it is returned by
their many ramifications to the portal vein and
the liver, and from this to the vena cava.4 The
blood in these veins is the same color and consis-
tency as in other veins, contrary to general opinion.

It is not true that there are two opposite move-
ments in these capillaries, chyle inward and blood
outward. To be so must be considered incongru-
ous and improbable rather than constituted by the
great wisdom of Nature. If chyle were mixed with
blood, the raw with the concocted‚ in equal parts,
no coction‚ or blood formation would follow. Rather
there would be a mixture of the two as in the ming-
ling of wine in water or syrup. But when a very
small amount of chyle is added to a lot of blood,

 

³ The factors concerned in skin absorption have attracted much
attention since the development of chemical warfare. No studies

have been made, that I know of, on the materials mentioned here.
