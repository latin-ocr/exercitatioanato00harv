were dilated at its base or origin. After awhile when
the fetus is outlined and the body begins to be more
substantial, this vesicle becomes more fleshy and
stronger, and its constitution changing, it turns into
the auricles. From these the bulk of the heart begins
to sprout, although as yet it has no function. When
the fetus is really developed, with bones separated
from flesh, when the body is perfected and has
motion, then the heart actually beats and, as I said,
pumps blood by both ventricles from the vena cava
to the arteries.

Thus divine Nature making nothing in vain, neither
gives a heart to an animal where it is not needed, nor
makes one before it can be used. By the same steps
in the development of every animal, passing through
the structural stages, I might say, of egg, worm, and
fetus, it obtains perfection in each. These points are
confirmed elsewhere by many observations on the
formation of the fetus.1²

Hippocrates, in the book De Corde, did not call the
heart a muscle without good reason.¹³ Its action or

Harvey was probably engaged, while this was published, on his other
great treatise, De generatione animalium, which appeared at the
solicitation and under the direction of Dr. George Ent, in London
in 1651. This is a remarkable volume, not yet properly annotated
or appreciated, a mine of observation and interpretation, and a com-
plete commentary on the ideas of Aristotle and Fabricius on fetal
development. As a sustained intellectual effort it surpasses the pres-
ent volume, and with the development of sexual physiology may be
recognized as a very significant contribution.

anatomical work of the Hippocratic collection. Written about
