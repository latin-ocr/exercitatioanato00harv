MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

how and when do they take in blood from the heart?
During systole is impossible: the arteries would
have to fill while contracted, or to fill and not be-
come distended. During diastole is improbable:
they would then receive for two contrary purposes
both blood and air, and heat and cold.

Further, when it is stated that the diastole of
the heart and arteries is simultaneous, and the
systole likewise, there is another inconsistency.
How can two bodies being connected together and
being distended at the same time draw anything
one from the other? Or being contracted simul-
taneously receive anything one from the other?
Moreover, it seems impossible that one body may
thus draw another body to itself in order to become
distended, since distention is passive, unless return
is made to a natural state, like a sponge previously
compressed by external force. It is hard to imagine
anything like this in the arteries.

The arteries distend because they are filled like
bladders or pouches and they are not filled because
they expand like a bellows, as I have easily and
clearly shown, and proved, I think, ere this. How-
ever, in Galen’s book, ¹Quod sang. cont. in Arter.,
there is an experiment to show the opposite: an
artery is exposed and cut longitudinally, and a reed
or hollow tube is inserted through the opening, so
the wound is closed and the blood not driven out.
“As long as it stays thus,'' he says, “the whole
artery will pulsate, but if you tie a thread around
