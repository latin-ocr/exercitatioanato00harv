MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

but on the basis of difference in function or use.
Both veins and arteries were called veins by the
ancients, and not unjustly‚ as Galen notes. The
arteries are the vessels carrying blood from the
heart to the body, the veins returning blood from
the body to the heart, the one the way from the
heart‚ the other toward the heart,² the latter carry-
ing imperfect blood unfit for nourishment, the
former perfected, nutritious blood.

 

² In so clearly differentiating the functions of arteries and veins,
why didn't Harvey go on and point out the confusion resulting from
the tlerpmindogy in use at the time with regard to the pulmonary
vesse s.
