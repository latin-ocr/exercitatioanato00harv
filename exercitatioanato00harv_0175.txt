MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

pumped out. But as I have determined in the sheep,
the whole body does not contain more than four
pounds of blood.

On this assumption of the passage of blood, made
as a basis for argument, and from the estimation
of the pulse rate, it is apparent that the entire
quantity of blood passes from the veins to the ar-
teries through the beart, and likewise through
the lungs.

But suppose this would not occur in half an honr,
but rather in an hour, or even in a day, it is still
clear that more blood continually flows through
the heart than can be supplied by the digested food
or be held in the veins at any one time.

It cannot be said that the heart in contracting
sometimes pumps and sometimes doesn't, or that it
propels a mere nothing or something imaginary.
This point has been settled previously, and besides,
it is contrary to common sense. If the ventricles
must be filled with blood in cardiac dilatation, some-
thing must always be pushed out in contraction,
and not a little amount either, since the passages
are not small nor the contractions few. This quantity
expelled is some proportion of the contents of the
ventricle, a third, a sixth, or an eighth, and an
equivalent amount of blood must fill it up in diastole,

argument, and the first instance of the quantitive method in physi-
ology. It introduced the most important method of reasoning in the
science and demonstrated its most significant truth.
