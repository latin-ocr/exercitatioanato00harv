MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

artery, and likewise constantly is drawn into the
left ventricle from the lungs, as is obvious from
what has been said and the position of the valves,
it cannot do otherwise than flow through contin-
uously. Then, as blood constantly pours into the
right ventricle of the heart, and constantly moves
out of the left, it is impossible, for the same reasons
as above, obviously reasonable, for it to do otherwise
than pass continually from the vena cava to the
aorta.

It is evident from dissection that this occurs
through wide open channels in all animals before
birth, and from Galen's words and what has been
said previously it is equally manifest that it occurs
in adults by tiny pores and vascular openings through
the lungs.⁵ So it appears that, whereas one ventricle
of the heart, the left, suffiees for distributing blood
to the body, and drawing it from the vena cava, as

 

⁵ It is interesting to note how much Harvey relies on the tradi-
tional authorities to prove his points. The only contemporary au-
thority referred to is R. Columbus (1516—1559), although M. Ser-
vetus (1509—1553)‚ and A. Caesalpinus (1524—1603) had also described
the pulmonary circulation. The latter, indeed, had discussed the
general circulation, so naming the phenomenon, and had postulated
vasa in capillamenta resoluta, or anastomoses between arteries and
veins. Dr. J. C. Hemmeter (Johns Hopkins Hosp. Ball„ 16: 165,
1905) suggests, in his excellent essay, that since both Servetus and
Caesalpinus had offended the theologiam, Harvey was afraid to men-
tion them. It has been observed (Chap. IV, Note 6) that Harvey
apparently had little sear of theological consequences. In view of
Harvey’s honesty it is hard to believe that he really knew of the work
of these men. The “vascular openings'’ between arteries and veins
were first demonstrated in the frog’s lung by Marcello Malpighi
(1628-1694), first great histologist.
