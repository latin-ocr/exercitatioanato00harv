CHAPTER ΙΙΙ

The Movements of tlze Arteries as Seen
in Animal Experimentation

···>·—-6›0<*-·⁴w

N CONNECTION with the movements of the

heart one may observe these facts regarding
the movements and pulses of the arteries:

1. At the instant the heart contracts, in systole,
and strikes the breast, the arteries dilate, give a
pulsation, and are distended.‘ Also, when the right
ventricle contracts and expels its content of blood,
the pulmonary artery beats and is dilated along with
the other arteries of the body.

2. When the left ventricle stops beating or con-
tracting, the pulsations in the arteries cease, or the
contractions being weak, the pulse in the arteries is
scarcely perceptible. A similar cessation of the
pulse in the pulmonary artery occurs when the right
ventricle stops.

3. If any artery be cut or punctured, the blood
spurts forcibly from the wound when the left ven-
tricle contracts. Likewise‚ if the pulmonary artery
is cut, blood vigorously squirts out when the right
ventricle con tracts.

In fishes, also, if the blood vessel leading from
the heart to the gills is cut open, the blood will be
seen to spurt out when the heart contracts.
