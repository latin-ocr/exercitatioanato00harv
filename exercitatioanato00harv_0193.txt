INCE these things are so, it establishes the

proof of what I said previously, that blood
continually passes through the heart. For we have
seen that blood spreads from the arteries to the
veins, not from veins to arteries; we have seen
further that almost the total amount of blood can
be taken from an arm if a single cutaneous vein
be opened with a lancet and a bandage properly
applied, and we have seen still further, that there
is so much force behind it, and so sufficient a flow
that the blood may easily and quickly be with-
drawn not only in the amount present in the arm
below the ligature before the cut was made, but
in the whole arm, and in the entire body, arteries
as well as veins.
