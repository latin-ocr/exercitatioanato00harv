APPENDI X I

support in this and similar fancies I owe much to my wife's
interest, and to that of the genial members of the Dick Marshall
Dining Club. I am especially thankful to the Oxford University
Press for kind permission to reproduce several of the splendid
illustrations from Portraits of Dr. W illium Harvey (1913).

Many efforts are being made this year to celebrate appro-
priately the tercentennial of the appearance of Harvey's great
book. The Royal Society of Physicians of London and the
Harvey Society of New York held special festivals. R. Lier
and Co. of Florence and the Nonesuch Press are issuing fac-
similes of the original work. While these challenge the atten—
tion of connoiseurs, this volume has been prepared chiefly in
the hope that it may interest medical and advanced zoological
students, by offering in a dignified but inexpensive way an
opportunity to become acquainted‚ intellectually, with one of
the greatest contributors to their subjects. To that end the
publisher and printers have done more than their share to make
my little part easy.

It has been a delight to work with Mr. Thomas in the prepa-
ration of this volume, and I appreciate his continued courtesy
and enthusiasm.
