MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

blood. This may not seem of much importance. Respira-
tory sanction, however, would suffer, and this would be
of no little significance.” Again‚ a little later: “Another
serious inconvenience would follow if our Maker had
not provided these valves‚ the blood would move back-
wards during expirations.’' So, in the 11th chapter,
he concludes: “It seems that all these valves have a
common function in preventing regurgitation‚ ap-
propriate to both directions, one set leading away from
the heart and preventing return by that route, the other
leading into the heart and preventing escape from it.
Nature never wished to fatigue the heart with useless
work, neither bringing anything unnecessarily to it, nor
taking anything unnecessarily from it. Thus there are
four openings, two in each ventricle, one of which leads
into the heart, the other out of it.” A bit farther on:
“One of the blood-vessels fastened on the heart has a
simple tunic, the other leading from it has a double
tunic. (Galen is referring to the right ventricle‚ but
the same things apply to the left.) The same cavity
being provided for both of these, blood enters through the
former and leaves through the latter.’'

Galen proposes this argument to explain the
passage of blood from the vena cava through the
right ventricle to the lungs. By merely changing
the terms‚ we may apply it more properly to the
transfer of blood from the veins through the heart
to the arteries. From the words of that great Prince
of Physicians‚ Galen, it seems clear that blood filters
through the lung from the pulmonary artery to the
