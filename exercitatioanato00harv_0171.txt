MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

the sun gives off vapors, which, rising, are condensed
to fall again moistening the earth. By this means
things grow. So also tempests and meteors originate
by a circular approach and recession of the sun.

Thus it happens in the body by the movement of
the blood, all parts are fed and warmed by the more
perfect, more spiritous, hotter, and, I might say,
more nutritive blood. But in these parts this blood
is cooled, thickened, and loses its power, so that it
returns to its source, the heart, the inner temple
of the body, to recover its virtue.

Here it regains its natural heat and fluidity, its
power and vitality, and filled with spirits, is dis-
tributed again. All this depends on the motion and
beat of the heart.

So the heart is the center of life, the sun of the
Microcosmâ€š as the sun itself might be called the
heart of the world. The blood is moved, invigorated,
and kept from decaying by the power and pulse
of the heart. It is that intimate shrine whose func-
tion is the nourishing and warming of the whole
body, the basis and source of all life. But of these
matters we may speculate more appropriately in
considering the final causes of this motion.

The vessels for the conduction of blood are of two
sorts, the vena cava type and the aortic type. These
are to be classified, not on the basis of structure or
make-up, as commonly thought with Aristotle,
for in many animals, as I have said, the veins do
not differ from the arteries in thickness of tumes,
