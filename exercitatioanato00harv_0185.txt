MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

may cause gangrene in the limbs, and what their
function may be in castrating animals or removing
fleshy tumors.

Because no one has understood the rationale
of these matters, it has happened that almost every-
one recommends ligatures in treating disease on the
authority of the ancients‚ and very few use them
properly or get any benefit from them.

Some ligatures are tight, others middling. I
call a ligature tight when it is pulled so firmly about
a limb that the beat of the artery cannot be felt
beyond it. We use this kind in amputations to
control bleeding. This kind is also used in castrating
animals and removing tumors‚ where we see the tes-
ticles and tumors dying and dropping off because
the ligature keeps out heat and nourishment.

I call a ligature middling which compresses a
limb on all sides, but without pain, so that the
artery may still pulsate somewhat beyond the
ligature. This type is used for “drawing,'' in blood-
letting. The proper ligature for phlebotomy is applied
above the elbow in such a manner that the artery at
the wrist may still be felt beating slightly.

Now, let an experiment be made on a man's
arm, using a bandage as in blood-letting, or grasp-
ing tightly with the hand.l The best subject is one

 

¹These interesting experiments, discussed in a quantitative way
in Chapter XIII, imply some of the factors involved in arterial and
venous blood pressure. Attention was sharply drawn to the mechanical
relations of blood-pressure by the Rev. Stephen Hales (1677-1761) and
