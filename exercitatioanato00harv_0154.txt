AN ANATOMJCAL S TUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

the beart, which plainly transmits it by a tube
analogous to an artery. This may be confirmed by
inspection, or section of the artery‚ the blood spurting
with each beat of the heart.

It is not hard to see the same thing in other animals
with but a single ventricle, as toads, frogs, serpents
and lizzards. They have lungs of a sort, as a voice.
I have made notes on the excellent structure of their
lungs, but they are not appropriate here. It is
obvious in opening these animals that the blood is
transferred from the veins to the arteries by the
heart beat. The way is wide open; there is no dif-
ficulty or hesitancy about it; it is the same as it would
be in man were the septum of the heart perforated or
removed, making one ventricle of the two, Were this
so, no one would doubt, I think, how blood passes
from veins to arteries.

Since there really are more animals without lungs
than with them, and also more with a single ventricle
in the heart than with two, it may be concluded that
for the majority of animals, an open way exists for
blood to pass through the cavity of the heart from
the veins to the arteries.

I have perceived further that the same thing is
very apparent in the embryos of animals possessing
lungs.

It is well known by all anatomists that the four
blood vessels belonging to the heart, the vena cava,
pulmonary artery‚ pulmonary vein, and aorta, are
connected differently in the fetus than in the adult.
