heart, by a transfer accomplished from the great
veins, since it passes through the arteries beneath
the ligature, not through veins, and arteries never
receive blood from veins except by way of the left
ventricle of the heart. Nor could any such an amount
be drawn from a single vein anywhere, a bandage
being applied above it, especially with such force,
such an amount, or so easily and quickly, except
by the beating power of the heart in the manner
described.

If these things are s0, we may very readily compute
the amount of blood and come to some conclusion
on its circular motion. If, for instance, in phle-
botomy, one were to let the blood flow with its usual

' force and rate for a half hour, there is no doubt but

that the greater part of it would be drained off,
practically emptying not only arteries but also the
great veins, and that fainting and syncope would
follow. It is reasonable to assume that as great an
amount of blood as is lost in this half hour’s time,
passed from the great veins through the heart to
the aorta. Further‚ if you figure how many ounces
of blood fiow through a single arm, or pass under
a medium bandage in twenty or thirty heart-beats,
you will have a basis for estimating how much
flows through the other arm in the same time,
or through both sides of the neck, or through
both legs, and through all the other arteries and
veins of the body. Since all these are continually
supplied with fresh blood, which must flow through
