MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

blood. At this same time when the auricles alone
are beating‚ if you cut off the tip of the heart with a
scissors, you will see blood gush out at each beat of
the auricles. This shows how blood enters the
ventricles, not by the suction or dilatation of the
ventricles, but by the beat of the auricles.

Note that when Ι speak of the pulsations of the
auricles or of the heart, I mean contractions. First
the auricles contract, then afterwards the heart
itself. When the auricles contract they become
pale, especially when they hold little blood (for they
are filled as reservoirs, the blood freely pressing
toward them through the Veins).4 This whiteness
is most apparent near their edges when they con-
tract.

In fishes, frogs and other animals having a
single ventricle in the heart, at the base of which
the auricle is swollen like a bladder with blood,
you may see this bladder contract first, plainly

 

⁴ The first intimation of the existence of venous pressure. A more
literal translation would read “freely tending by the compressing
motion of the veins.” While the veins are not now considered to exert
much elastic pressure, it is taught that muscular activity exerts pres-
sure on the veins. Harvey discusses the functions of the venous valves
in Chapter 13. There is little emphasis in current physiological texts
on auricular conti-action filling the ventricles, although careful investi-
gators estimate that between 18 and 60 per cent of the blood content
of the ventricles is forced in by auricular contractiori (Wiggers‚ C. J.,
The circulation in Health and Disease, Phila., 2nd Ed., 1923.) The
current opinion is that venous pressure largely determines the diastolic
filling, and thus the “stroke-volume’' of the ventricles. For a recent
review of the significance of venous pressure, consult J. A. E. Eyster’s
paper, thysiological Reviews, 6: 281 (Apr.) 1926.
