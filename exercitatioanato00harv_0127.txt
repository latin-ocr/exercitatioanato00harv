ΜΟΤΙΟΝ OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

None age so perfectly that subtle change

With time or custom seems not new nor strange;
What's once believed is now denied, and what
Was honored once now suffers in exchange.

So may it now be regarding the motion of the heart.
The path is open for others, starting here, to progress
more fortunately and more correctly under a more
propitious genius.

 

lines may be excused on the plea that it places the context in the ap-
propriately tolerant and resigned verse-form made famous by Edward
FitzGerald. Dr. Willis, in his 1847 Harvey, translates the lines in the
Classical tradition:

For never yet hath' any one attained

To such perfection‚ but that time, and place,
And use, have brought addition to his knowledge;
Or made correction, or admonished him

That he was ignorant of much which he

Had thought he knew; or led him to reject

What he had once esteemed of highest price.

George Colman’s translation is quoted by T. B. Harbottle, Dictionary
of Quotations (Classical), London and New York‚ 1897.
