MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

In tertian fever, the cause of the sickness first
seeking the beart, lingers about the heart and lungs
and causes shortness of breath, sighing and languor.
This happens because the vital energy is depressed‚
and because the blood, driven into the lungs, thick-
ens and cannot pass through, as Ι have noted in
autopsies on those dying during the beginning of
the disease. Then the pulse is rapid, feeble, and
somewhat irregular. When the heat increases, the
blood thins out, and an open passage is made, then
the whole body warms, the pulse becomes strong
and full during the febrile state, while the abnormal
heat kindled in the heart is scattered from there
to the body, through the arteries, along with the
morbific matter, which is thus naturally dissolved
and overpowered.2

This may also explain why some medical agents
applied to the skin have almost as much effect as if
taken by mouth. Colocynth and aloes applied
externally move the bowels, cantharides excites

 

may be filtered out before the lymph passes into the veins. Harvey’s
reasoning here gave a new turn to the old humoral pathology‚ again
unfortunately neglected by physicians until long after.

² It is interesting, in view of our present conceptions of immune
reactions to infectious processes, that Harvey should have implied
that sever is a beneficial response in the infected individual. The
success of Peruvian or Jesuits’ bark‚—called cinchona from the
Spanish Countess Chinchona, one of the first Europeans to benefit
from it (1638),—in relieving malarial severs, obscured the signi-
ficance of Harvey's implication until recently. The general feeling
developed that the fever should be reduced at any' cost. Hence the

extraordinary interest with the rise of synthetic organic chemistry
in the “antipyretics.'’
