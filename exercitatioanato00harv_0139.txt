ΜΟΤῙΟΝ OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

not four movements distinct in time, but only in
space. The two auricles beat together and so do the
two ventricles, so that there are four distinct move-
ments in space, but only two in time. This happens
as follows.

Two sets of movements occur together, one of the
auricles, another of the ventricles. These are not
simultaneous, but that of auricles precedes that
of the rest of the heart. The movement seems to
start in the auricles and to spread to the ventricles.²
When the heart slows in approaching death, or in
fishes and cold-blooded animals, there is a pause
between the two movements, and the heart seems
to respond to the motion as if aroused, sometimes
quickly, sometimes slowly. At length, nearly dead,
it fails to respond to the motion, and it stirs so ob-
scurely that the only signs of motion are pulsations
of the auricle, as if just lightly nodding the head.
The heart thus stops beating before the auricles,
and the latter may be said to outlive it. The left
ventricle stops beating first of all, then its auricle,
then the right ventricle, and, finally, as indeed
Galen noted, when all the rest is quiet and dead, the
right auricle still pulsates. Life, therefore, seems
to remain longest in the right auricle. While the
heart gradually dies, it sometimes responds with a

tion of the heart beat. For a recent comprehensive discussion of this
question see Eyster, J. A. E. and Meek, W. J.‚ Physiological Reviews,
