MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

⁴ above the ligature unless it is completely loosened.
Then we see the veins suddenly collapse‚ discharg-
ing themselves to the part above, the hand loses
its flush, and the stagnant blood and swelling quickly
fade away.

Further, he whose arm has been bound for some
time with a medium bandage, and whose hand has
been rendered somewhat swollen and cold, feels,
as the ligature is loosened, something cold creeping
up with the returning blood to the elbow or arm-
pit. I think this cold blood returning to the heart‚
after removing the bandage in blood-letting, is a
cause of fainting, which we sometimes see even in
robust persons, usually when the ligature is removed,
or, as is commonly said, when the blood turns„

Moreover, immediately on loosening a tight
bandage to a medium one, we see the veins below
it, but not the arteries‚ swollen with blood contin-
ually carried in by the arteries. This indicates that
blood passes from arteries to veins, not the reverse,
and that there is either an anastomosis of these
vessels or pores in the fiesh and solid parts per-
meable to blood. It also indicates that the veins
inter-communicate, since, with a medium ligature
above the elbow, they all swell up at the same time,
and, if even a single venule be cut with a lancet‚
they all quickly shrink‚ giving up their blood to
this one, and subside almost together.

Anyone may understood from this the reasons
for the “drawing'’ power existing in ligatures, and
