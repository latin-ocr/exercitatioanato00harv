MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

and function of the beart and arteries must seem
obscure, inconsistent, or impossible to the thought-
ful student. It will therefore be proper to investigate
the matter more closely, to study the movement of
the heart and arteries not only in man but in all
animals possessing a heart, and to search out and
find the truth by frequent experiments in living
animals, and by constant observation.
