AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

a glove or bladder, or like in a drum or long beam,
when the stroke and beat occur together, even at
the extremities. Aristotle says (De Animal. 3, Cap.
9), “The blood of all animals throbs in the veins (ar-
teries are meant), and by the pulse is sent everywhere
at once.'’ And again (De Respirat. Cap. 15), “All
veins pulsate together intermittently, because they all
depend on the heart. As it is always in intermittent
movement, so they move together, intermittentlyf'
It is to be noted, according to Galen (De Plac.
Hippocr. δέ) Plat., Cap. 9), that the ancient philos-
ophers referred to the arteries as veins.

Ionce had a case in charge which convinced me of
this truth. This person had a large pulsating tumor,
called an aneurysm, on the right neck where the
subclavian artery descends toward the axilla. Caused

 

to reach, that·the pulse corresponds in all particulars to the heart
beat, and it is reasonable to believe Harvey studied and pondered
over the problem for a long time.

Erasistratus noted that the pulse progresses as a wave, but this
was denied by Galen. Both Albrecht von Haller (1708-1777), Elementa
Physiologiae 1757, tom. 1, p. 447, and M.-F.-Xavier Bichat (1771-
1802), agreed with Harvey that the pulse is synchronous in all the
arteries. Ernst HeinrichWeber(1795-1878)in 1827 first showed a delay
in transmission. From his observations, first printed in his Pulsum
arteriarum, Leipzig, 1827, one may calculate the velocity of the pulse-
wave to be 9.2 meters per second, and its length 3 meters. More re-
cent determinations of the velocity show it to be somewhat slower (see
W. H. Howell’s splendid Physiology, 10th Ed., Phila„ 1927, p. 527).
For an authoritative appreciation of E. H. Weber, consult P. M.
Dawson's delightful account in the William Snow Miller Festschrift,
the May 1928 issue,Vol. 25,of the Quarterly of the Phi Beta Pi Medical
Fraternity. The velocity of blood-flow, in a given vessel, an entirely
different proposition, was carefully investigated by Carl Ludwig

(1816-1895)-
