MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

Finally, in arteriotomy, the blood is seen squirted
alternately far and near, the greater spurt coming
with the distention of the artery, at the time the
heart strikes the ribs. This is the moment the
heart contracts and is in systole, and it is by this
motion that the blood is ejected.

Contrary to the usual teaching‚ it is clear from
the facts, that the diastole of the arteries corresponds
to the systole of the heart, and that the arteries
are filled and distended by the blood forced into
thern by the contraction of the ventricles. The
arteries are distended because they are filled like
sacs, not because they expand like bellows. All
the arteries of the body pulsate because of the same
cause, the contraction of the left ventricle. Likewise
the pulmonary artery pulsates because of the con-
traction of the right ventricle.

To illustrate how the beat in the arteries is due to
the impulse of blood from the left ventricle‚ one may
blow into a glove, distending all the fingers at one
and the same time, like the pulse. The pulse cor-
responds to the tension of the heart in> frequency,
rhythm‚ volume, and regularity. Because of the
motion of the blood it is reasonable to expect the
heart beat and the dilatation of the arteries, even the
more distant ones, to go together.1 It is like inflating

 

¹ Rather interesting that Harvey should have avoided the idea of a
transmission of the pulse-wave, especially since in Chapter 5 he dis-
cusses the transmission of the wave of contractiori over the heart itself.
Did he attempt to time with the inadequate instruments of his day the
apex beat and say the pulse at the wrist? Itis rather a broad conclusion
