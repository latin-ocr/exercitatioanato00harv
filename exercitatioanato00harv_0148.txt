be apparent, especially in warm-blooded animals
where it happens rapidly. This is like a piece of
machinery in which one wheel moves another,
though all seem to move simultaneously, or like
the mechanism in fire—arms, where touching the
trigger brings down the flint, lights a spark, which
falls in the powder and explodes it, firing the ball,
which reaches the mark. All these events because
of their quickness seem to occur simultaneously
in the twinking of an eye. Likewise in swallowing:
lifting the tongue and pressing the mouth forces the
food to the throat, the larynx and the epiglottis
are closed by their own muscles, the gullet rises and
opens its mouth like a sac, and receiving the bolus
forces it down by its transverse and longitudinal
muscles. All these diverse movements‚ carried out
by different organs, are done so smoothly and
regularly that they seem to be a single movement
and action, which we call swallowing.

So it happens in the movement and action of the
heart, which is sort of a deglutition or transference
of blood from the veins to the arteries. If anyone
with these points in mind will carefully watch the
cardiac action in a living animal, he will see, not only
what I have said, that the heart contracts in a con-
tinuous movement with the auricles, but also a

 

mates the current attitude. The classical descriptions of deglutition
are by F. Magendie (1783—1855), Precis clement. de Physiol., 2: 58,
1817, and by H. Kronecker(1839—1914)and S. J. Meltzer (1851-1921),
Arch. f. Physiol., 1880, 299 and 446.
