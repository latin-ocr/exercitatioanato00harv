AN ANATOMICAL 'STUDY ΘΝ THE

so that there is a relation between the ventricular
capacity in contraction and in dilatation. Since the
ventricles in dilating do not become filled with
nothing, or with something imaginary‚ so in con-
tracting they never expel nothing or something
imaginary, but always blood in an amount pro-
portionate to the contraction.

So it may be inferred that if the heart in a single

beat in man, sheep, or ox, pumps one dram, and
there are 1‚ooo beats in half an hour, the total

amount pumped in that time would be ten pounds
five ounces; if two drams at a single stroke, then
twenty pounds ten ounces; if half an ounce, then
forty-one pounds eight ounces3 and if one ounce,
then a total of eighty-three pounds four ounces, all
of which would be transferred from the veins to
the arteries in half an hour.

The amount pumped at a single beat, and the
factors involved in increasing or diminishing it,
may perhaps be more carefully studied later from
many observations of mine.2

 

² This has remained a most important question ever since. An
excellent general review of the subject is Y. Henderson's Volume
Changes ofthe Heart, Physiol. Rev. ‚z3 165,1923. Various types of
experiments indicate a “stroke volume'' of the heart of 1. 5 to 2 cc. per
kilo body weight, maintained with a fair degree of constancy. In
the effort to find a simple satisfactory method to measure cardiac out-
put, Y. Henderson and H. Haggard (Arner J. Physiol„ 73; 193,1925)
propose the determination of the rate of absorption of a slightly solu-
ble gas, suggesting ethyl iodide. The difference between the ethyl
iodide content of inspired and expired air times the minute· volume
of respiration gives the minute· volume of the gas absorbed. The
alveolar concentration times the coefficient of solubility gives the
