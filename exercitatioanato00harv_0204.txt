MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

for in some way, by the greater frequency or better
action of the succeeding valves. So, as the veins
are the wide open passages for returning blood to
the heart, they are adequately prevented from
distributing it from the heart.

Above all, note this. With the arm of your sub-
ject bound, the veins distended, and the nodes or
valves prominent, apply your thumb to a vein a
little below a valve so as to stop the blood coming
up from the hand, and then with your finger press
the blood from that part of the vein up past the
valve (L, N, fig. 4), as was said before. Remove
your thumb (L), and the vein at once fills up from
below (as in D, C, fig. Ι). Again compress with
your thumb, and squeeze the blood out in the same
way as before (L, N, and H, Ο), and do this a thou-
sand times as quickly as possible. By careful reckon-
ing, of course, the quantity of blood forced up beyond
the valve by a single compression may be estimated,
and this multiplied by a thousand gives so much blood
transmitted in this way through a single portion of
the veins in a relatively short time, that without
doubt you will be very easily convinced by the quick-
ness of its passage of the circulation of the blood.

But you may say this experiment of mine violates
natural conditions. Then if you will take as long
a distance from the valve as possible, observing
how quickly, on releasing your thumb, the blood
wells up and fills the vein from below, I do not
doubt but that you will be thoroughly convinced.
