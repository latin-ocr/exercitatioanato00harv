ΜΟΤΙΟΝ OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

you will press downwards against the valve, (O,
fig. 3) by a finger of the other hand on the distended
upper portion (K, fig. 3), you will note that nothing
can be forced through the valve. The greater effort
you make the more the vein is distended toward
the valve, but you will observe that it stays empty
below it (H, O, fig. 3).

From many such experiments it is evident that the
function of the valves in the veins is the same as
that of the three sigmoid valves placed at the
opening of the aorta and pulmonary artery, to
prevent, when they are tightly closed, the reflux
of blood passing over them.

Further, with the arm bound as before and the
veins swollen, if you will press on a vein a little
below a swelling or valve (L, fig. 4) and then squeeze
the blood upwards beyond the valve (N) with
another finger (M), you will see that this part of
the vein stays empty, and that no back flow can
occur through the valve (as in H, O, fig. 2). But
as soon as the finger (H) is removed, the vein is
filled from below (as in D, C, fig. 1). Thus it is
clearly evident that blood moves through the veins
toward the heart, from the periphery inwards, and
not in the opposite direction. The valves in some
places, either because they do not completely close,
or because they occur singly, do not seem adequate
to block a flow of blood from the center, but the
majority certainly do. At any rate, wherever they
seem poorly made, they appear to be compensated
