MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

the lungs and ventricles of the heart, from the veins,
it must be accomplished in a circuit, since the
amount involved is much more than can be fur-
nished from the food consumed, or than is needed for
the nourishment of the parts.

It is further to be observed that this truth is often
demonstrated in blood-letting. Though you prop-
erly bandage the arm, and puncture the vein
correctly with a lancet, if a fainting state of mind
comes on through fear or any other cause, and the
heart beats more sluggishly‚ blood will escape only
a drop at a time, especially if the ligature be made
a little more tight. The reason is that the feeble
beat in the compressed artery, with the weaker
propelling power, cannot force the blood under
the bandage.¹ For the same reason the feeble and
languid heart cannot force the normal amount
of blood through the lungs or transfer it from the
veins to the arteries. In the same way and for the
same reasons, it happens that the menses of women
and all types of hemorrhages are checked. If the
opposite occurs, the patient recovering his mind,
and losing his sear, you will see the arteries at once
beat more powerfully, even in the bound-off part,
so the blood gushes from the opening and flows
steadily.

 

¹ A characteristic example of Harvey’s clear reasoning. It is
easily inferred that the obvious factor in maintaining blood pressure
is the pumping action of the heart.
