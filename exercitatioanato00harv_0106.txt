fairly demonstrated; neither do they think it unworthy of them
to change their opinion if truth and undoubted demonstration
require them so to do; nor do they esteem it discreditable to
desert error, though sanctioned by the highest antiquity3 for
they know full well that to err, to be deceived, is human; that
many things are discovered by accident, and that many may be
learned indifferently from any quarter, by an old man from a
youth, by a person of understanding from one of inferior
capacity. ,

My dear colleagues, I had no purpose to swell this treatise
into a large volume by quoting the names and writings of anato-
mists, or to make a parade of the strength of my memory‚ the
extent of my reading, and the amount of my pains; because I
profess both to learn and to teach anatomy, not from books
but from dissections; not from the positions of philosophers but
from the fabricof nature;and then because 1 do not think it right
or proper to strive to take from the ancients any honour that
is their due, nor yet to dispute with the moderns, and enter
into controversy with those who have excelled in anatomy and
been my teachers‚ I would not charge with wilful falsehood
any one who was sincerely anxious for truth, nor lay it to any
one’s door as a crime that he had fallen into error. I avow myself
the partisan of truth alone3 and I can indeed say that Ι have
used all my endeavours, bestowed all my pains on an attempt
to produce something that should be agreeable to the good,
profitable to the learned, and useful to letters.

Farewell, most worthy Doctors‚
And think kindly of your Anatomist‚
WILLIAM HARVEY.
