CHAPTER II

The Motions of the Heart as Observed

in Animal Experiments

-··>·—⁴›e<§—-4··

N THE first place, when the chest of a living

animal is opened, and the capsule surrounding
the heart is eut away,1 one may see that the heart
alternates in movement and rest. There is a time
when it moves, and a time when it is quiet.

This is more easily seen in the hearts of cold-
blooded animals, as toads, snakes, frogs, snails,
shell-fish, crustaceans, and fish. It is also more
apparent in other animals as the dog and pig, if one
carefully observes the heart as it moves more slowly
when about to die. The movements then become
slower and weaker and the pauses longer, so that it
is easy to see what the motion really is and how made.
During a pause, the heart is soft‚ flaccid, exhausted‚
as in death.

Three significant features are to be noted in the
motion and in the period of movement:

 

¹ The only reference to the pericardium made by Harvey. The idea
that it prevents overdistention of the heart probably never occurred

to him. For current ideas on the function of the pericardium see
J. A. Wilson and W. J. Meek‚ Amer. J. Physiol., 82: 34 (Sept.) 1927.
