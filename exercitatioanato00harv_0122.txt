AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

left ventricle by the foramen ovale, from the vena
cava through the pulmonary vein, how is it likely
in the adult to pass so plentiously and with no effort
through the cardiae septum, now denser with age?

On the authority of Galen (de loc. affert. lib. 6,
cap. 7), and the experience of Hollerius, Andreas
Laurentius (lib. 9, cap. II, questione I2) asserts
that the serum and pus in empyema, absorbed
from the thoracic cavity into the pulmonary vein,
can be eliminated through the left ventricle of the
heart and the arteries in the urine and feces. As
evidence he cites a certain case of melancholy, who
suffering from fainting spells‚ was relieved from
the seizures by voiding some turbid and fetid urine.
Worn out by the disease he finally died. On opening
the body none of the material he exereted was found
in the bladder or kidneys. In the left heart, how-
ever, and in the thoracic cavity‚ there was much of
it, and Laurentius boasts he predicted the cause of
the symptoms. I wonder, since he predicted that
such conglomerate material was evacuated as in-
dicated,1⁰ why he could not, or would not discern
that the blood is naturally carried from the lungs
to the left ventricle in the same way.

From these and many other considerations it is
clear that what has so far been said on the movement

 

¹⁰ How much of this is sarcasm against the pathology? Jacob
Hollerius lived between 1498 and 1562. Andreas Laurentius (1550-
1609) migrated from Montpellier to Paris, and although physician to
Henry IV, was considered an ignorant man.
