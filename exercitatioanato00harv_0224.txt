AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ THE

to fit exactly, in others poorly and negligently, so that
they may be closed according to the greater or lesser
impulse from the contraction of the ventricles. In
the left ventricle, therefore, that the closure may be
made more complete against the stronger impulse,
there are only two, placed like a miter, and length-
ened in a conical form so they may come together
medianly and close very exactly. This probably led
Aristotle to consider this ventricle double, divided
transversely. Likewise, that blood may not escape
back into the pulmonary vein and thus reduce the
power of the left ventricle to pump blood through the
whole body, these mitral valves surpass in size,
strength, and exactness of closure those placed in the
right ventricle. Hence, necessarily, no heart can be
found without a ventricle since there must be a source
and store-house for blood.

The same does not always hold for the brain.⁷
Almost no kind of bird has a ventricle in the brain, as
is clear in the goose and swan, whose brains nearly
equal in size that of the rabbit. But the rabbit has
ventricles in the brain while the goose does not.

Wherever there is a single ventricle in the heart, a
flaccid, membranous, hollow, blood-filled auricle is
appended. Where two ventricles exist, there are like-

 

⁷ This paragraph and the last sentence of the preceding seem to
be unnecessary appendages to the argument. They appear in the
middle of a long paragraph which has been broken up for greater
ease in reading. Was Harvey implying that there is no necessary
stote-house for “animal spirits” in the brain as there is for “vital-
spirits'’ (or blood) in the heart?
