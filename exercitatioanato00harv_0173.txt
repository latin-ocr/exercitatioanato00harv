The Circulatzon of the Blood is Proved by

a Prime Consideration

F ANYONE says these are empty words, broad

assertions without basis, or innovations without
just cause, there are three points coming for proof,
from which I believe the truth will necessarily
follow, and be clearly evident.

Fir-st, blood is constantly being transmitted from
the vena cava to the arteries by the heart beat in
such amounts that it cannot be furnished by the food
consmned, and in such a way that the total quantity
must pass through the heart in a short tme.

Second, blood is forced by the pulse in the arteries
continually and steadily to every part of the body
in a much greater amount than is needed for nutri-
