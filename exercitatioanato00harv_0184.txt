CHAPTER XI

The Second Proposition is Proven

···›·—-o›0<>-‹·-·

UR second proposition may appear more clearly

by considering certain experiments from which
it is obvious that blood enters a limb through the
arteries and returns through the veins, that the
arteries are the vessels carrying blood from the
heart and the veins the channels returning it to
the heart‚ and that, in the extremities‚ blood passes
from arteries to veins directly by anastomosis or
indirectly through pores in the flesh, as discussed
before in regard to its transfer from veins to arteries
in the heart and thorax. From this it may be clear
that it moves in a circle from the center to the extremi-
ties and back from the extremities to the center.

Then, making certain calculations‚ it will also
be clear that the quantity may neither be supplied
from the food taken in nor necessarily be required
for nutrition.

These experiments will also clear up some points
regarding ligatures: why they may cause swelling,
which is neither by heat nor suction nor any reason
yet known; what uses and advantages may be
obtained from thern in practice3 how they may
either suppress or provoke hemorrhage; how they
