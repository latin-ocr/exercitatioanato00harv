Introduction

N DISCUSSING the movements and functions

of the heart and arteries, we should first con-
sider what others have said on these matters, and
what the common and traditional viewpoint is.
Then by anatomical study‚ repeated experiment‚
and careful observation, we may confirm what is
correctly stated, but What is false make right.

Nearly all anatomists, physicians, and philos-
ophers up to now have thought with Galen that the
pulse has the same function as respiration, differing
only in one respect, the former arising from an
animal, the latter a vital faculty, but from the
standpoint of function or movement behaving alike.
Thus one finds, as in the recent book on Respiration
by Hieronymus Fabricius of Aquapendente, that
since the pulsation of the heart and arteries is not
sufficient for the aeration and cooling of the blood,
Nature has placed the lungs around the heart.
So it seems that whatever has been said prior to
this about the systole and diastole of the heart and
arteries has been proposed with special reference
to the lungs.
