AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

flows through thern into the hand, as when a medium
bandage is used, but otherwise not, with a tight
ligature, except above it. Meanwhile, the veins
being compressed, nothing can fiow through them.
This is indicated by the fact that they are much
more swollen below the bandage than above it,
or than is usual with it removed, and that while
compressed they carry nothing under the ligature
to the parts above. So it is clear that the bandage
prevents the return of blood through the veins to
the parts above it and keeps those below it engorged.

The arteries, however, for the simple reason
that they are not blocked by the moderate ligature,
carry blood beyond it from the inside of the body
by the power and impulse of the heart. This is
the difference between a tight and medium bandage,
the former not only blocks the fiow of blood in the
veins but also in the arterieS, the latter does not
impede the pulsating force from spreading beyond
the ligature and carrying blood to the extremities of
the body.

One may reason as follows. Below a medium
bandage we see the veins become swollen and gorged
and the hand filled with blood. This must be caused
by blood passing under the ligature either in veins,
arteries or tiny pores. It cannot come through
the veins, certainly not through invisible ducts, so
it must fiow through the arteries, according to what
has been said. It obviously cannot flow through
the veins since the blood cannot be squeezed back
