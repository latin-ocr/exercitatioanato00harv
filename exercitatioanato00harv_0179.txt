ΜΟΤΙΟΝ OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

as arteries. The arteries receive blood from the
veins in no other way than by transmission through
the heart, as previously said. So by ligating the
aorta close to the beart, there need be no uncer-
tainty about finding the arteries empty if they be
opened in the neck or elsewhere, and the veins
filled.

The reason is now apparent why so much blood is
found in the veins in anatomical dissection, and
so little in the arteries, so much in the right side
of the beart, so little in the left. This fact prob-
ably led the ancients to believe that arteries con-
tained only spirits during an animal‘s life. The
reason for the difference is probably as follows.⁴
There is no other passage from the veins to the
arteries except through the heart and lungs, so
when an animal expires and the lungs stop moving,
the blood is prevented from passing from the pul-
monary artery to the pulmonary vein and then
into the left ventricle of the heart. This is like
what was noted previously in the embryO, where
the transit is prevented by the lack of motion in the
lungs and the opening and closing of its tiny pores.
The heart, however, does not stop at the same time

 

‘One reason has already been given. Is this an interpolation,
or addition to the original draft? There is much evidence that the
book was not composed as a whole, but that it is a combination of
many scattered notes written at different times. Respiration is
quite a factor in maintaining circulation. Dr. R. M. Waters, well-
known anesthetist, has told me of several instances where artificial
respiration has maintained a circulation when the heart has failed.
