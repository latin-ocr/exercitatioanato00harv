MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

some distance frorn the heart, have a more thick,
powerful, and muscular beart, as is obvious and
necessary. On the contrary, those whose structure
is more slender and soft have a more flaccid, less
massive, and weaker beart, with few or no fibers
internally.

Consider likewise the function of the sigmoid
valves. These are so made that blood once received
into the ventricles of the heart, or sent into the
pulmonary artery or aorta, can not regurgitate.
When they are raised and tightly joined, they form
a three pointed line, like the bite of a leech, and the
more tightly they are forced shut, the more do they
block the reflux of blood.

The tricuspids are like gate-keepers at the point
of inflow frorn the vena cava and pulmonary vein,
so that the blood, when strongly propelled, may
not escape back into them. They are not present
in all animals, for the reason stated, nor do they
seem to have been made with the same efficiency in
those in which they are found.⁰ In some they are made

 

⁶ This again raises the question as to whether or not Harvey ever
noted insufficiency or stenosis of the valves in humans. He is speak-
ing as an comparative anatomist here.

According to Galen (J. C. Dalton‚ Doctrines of the Circulation,
Phila„ 1884, p. 250), Erasistratus named the right anticulo-ventri-
cular valves “tricuspids'’ (τριὙλωχινας), and also called the valves
at the openings of the pulmonary artery and aorta “sigmoid'' in
shape. Since the old Greek sigma had the form of the letter C, this
gave a correct impression of their semilunar form. Vesalius, in his
immortal De Humani Corporis Fabrica, Basle, 1543, p. 592, first likens
the left anticulo-ventricular valves to a bishop's miter.
