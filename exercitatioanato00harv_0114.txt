AN ANATOMICAL S T UDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

the artery firmly pressing its tunics against the
tube you will see the artery does not beat as fully
beyond the noose.'' I have neither made this experi-
ment of Galen's, nor do I believe it can be done
easily in the living body because of the excessive
loss of blood from the artery. I doubt that the
tube would close up the wound without a ligature,
and that blood would not burst out between the
tube and the vessel. Yet Galen seems to prove⁵ by
this experiment both that the pulsating power
passes from the heart through the walls of the ar·
teries, and that the arteries while dilating are filled
by this pulsating power since they dilate like a
bellows and do not distend because they are filled
like a leather bottle.

The contrary, however, is apparent in arteriotomy
and wounds‚ the blood leaping from the artery
rushes out with force, first farther, then nearer,
alternately in spurts, the spurt being always during
the distention of the artery, never during its con-
tracture. From this it is obvious that the artery
is distended by the impulse of blood, for it is im-
possible for it per se to throw the blood with such
force while dilating,——it should rather be drawing
air into itself through the wound, according to the
common ideas on the functions of the arteries.

 

⁵ A little unfair to Galen (131-201 A.D.). Not only was the experi-

ment not tried, but unwarranted conclusions are unjustly ascribed to

hiim. This simile of the bellows and leather bottle is frequently used by
arvey.
