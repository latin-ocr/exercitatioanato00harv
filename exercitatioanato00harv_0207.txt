ΜΟΤΙΟΝ OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

back to its source and origin to take up heat or
spirit or whatever else it needs to be refreshened.

We often see the extremities so chilled by a cold
atmosphere that the hands, nose, and cheeks seem

the lower parts of a corpse‚ become livid. The
limbs are sluggish and are moved with difficulty,
so that they seem almost deprived of life. In no
other way can they recover heat, color, and life
so completely and especially so quickly as by a
freshly driven flow of heat from the source. But
how can they, when heat and life are almost gone,
draw anything into them? How can they, filled
with congealed stagnant blood, admit fresh blood
and nourishment, unless they give up their old con-
tents? Thus the heart really is the center where
this exhausted blood recovers life and heat, as
Aristotle says (De Respirat„ lib. 2). New blood
imbued with heat and spirit by it and sent out
through the arteries, forces onwards the chilled
and stagnant stuff, and the failing warmth and
vitality is restored in all parts of the body.

Hence as long as the heart is uninjured, life and
health can be restored to the body generally, but if
it is exhausted or harmed by any severe affliction,
the whole body must suffer and be injured.¹ When-
