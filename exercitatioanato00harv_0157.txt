MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

birth in man, and in certain animals‚ but even for
many months in others, as anatomists have noted,
and for years or life in still others, as in the goose,
snipe, and many birds and small animals. This per-
haps persuaded Botallus1 that he had found a new
passage for blood from the vena cava to the left
ventricle. I confess I almost thought so myself when
I first saw the condition in larger adult mice.

From this it appears that the same thing happens
in human and other embryos in which thesejunctions
are not closed: the heart, in its beat, forces the blood
through the wide open passages from the vena cava
to the aorta through the two ventricles. The right
ventricle, receiving blood from its auricle, propels it
through the pulmonary artery and its continuation,
called the ductus arteriasus, to the aorta. At the
same time the left ventricle contracts and sends into
the aorta the blood, which, received from the beat of
its auricle, has corne through the foramen ovale from
the vena cava.

In embryos, then, while the lungs are as inert and
motionless as though not present, Nature uses for
transmitting blood the two ventricles of the heart as
if they were one. The situation is the same in embryos

 

¹ L. Bottallus‚ a French anatomist of little ability, was born about
1530. “His very imperfect description of the ductus arteriasus, which
we know now to be due to the persistence of the fifth cephalic aortic
arch on the left side, appeared in 1565. To call the structure ductus
Botalli is an anachronism, as it was in fact well known to Galen.”
(C. Singer, The Evolutuon of Anatomy‚ New York 1925.) With what
skill and precision Harvey describes the fetal circulation!
