AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

perhaps in all fluxes. It is clear how the blood can-
not escape from the hand when the veins are com-
pressed with what I call a medium bandage, but
being driven in by the heart beat through the ar-
teries, and not being able to escape anywhere,
the part must necessarily become gorged and
swollen.

How can it be otherwise? Heat, pain, and the suc-
tion of a vacuum have a certain “drawing'' power
to fill a part, but not to distend or swell it abnor-
mally, nor to overcome it so suddenly and power-
sully by impact of blood that the fiesh and vessels
are in danger of being torn or ruptured. It is neither
believable nor demonstrable that heat, pain, or the
vis vacui can do this.

Furthermore, this “drawing’' power occurs in a
ligature without pain, heat, or the suction of a
vacuum. If pain happens to “draw'' any blood,
with the arm tied above the elbow, how may the
hand and fingers and their veins become swollen
below the ligature, since because of its pressure,
blood cannot get there through the veins? And
why is neither swelling, nor sign of venous filling
or engorgement, nor any vestige of “drawing''
apparent above the ligature?

The obvious cause of the “drawing'’ or abnormal
swelling in the hand and fingers below the bandage
is the forceful and copious influx of blood which
cannot escape. Indeed, is not the cause of all tumors
and oppressive swellings, what Avicenna says, that
