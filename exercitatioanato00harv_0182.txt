AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ THE

which blood may forcibly pour, but that nothing
like this happens in the intact body, with no out-
let made. With the arteries filled, in their natural
state, so large an amount cannot pass in so short
a time as to make a return necessary. It may be
replied that from the computation and reasons
already given, the excess contained in the dilated
heart in comparison with the constricted must
be in general pumped out with each beat and this
amount must be transmitted, as long as the body
is intact and in a natural state.

In serpents and certain fishes by ligating the
veins a little below the heart, you will see the space
between the ligature and the heart quickly become
empty. So, unless you deny what you see, you must
admit the blood returns to the heart. This will
be clear later in discussing the second proposition.

We may close here with a single conclusive ex-
ample, by which anyone may be convinced by his
own eyes.

If a live snake be cut open, the heart may be
seen quietly and distinctly beating for more than
an hour, moving like a worm and propelling blood
when it contracts longitudinally, for it is oblong.
It becomes pale in systole, the reverse in diastole,
and almost all the other things we have mentioned
as proving the truth may be clearly observed, for
here all happens slower and more distinctly. This
especially may be seen more clearly than the midday
sun. The vena cava enters at the lower part of the
