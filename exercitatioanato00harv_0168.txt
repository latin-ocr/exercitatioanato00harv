MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

is the case in all animals lacking lungs, Nature was
compelled, when she wished to filter blood through
the lungs, to add the right ventricle, whose beat
should force blood from the vena cava through
the lungs into the left ventricle. Thus the right
ventricle may be said to be made for the sake of
transmitting blood through the lungs, not for
nourishing thern. It is entirely unreasonable to
assume that the lungs need so much more abundant
nutriment, and coming directly from the heart, so
much purer and more spiritous blood than either
the very refined substance of the brain, or the very
brilliant and perfect structure of the eyes, or the
flesh of the heart itself which is adequately nourished
by the coronary artery.
