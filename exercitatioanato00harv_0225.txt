ΜΟΤΙΟΝ OF THE HEART ΛΝΒ BLOOD

wise two auricles. On the other hand, in some animals
there is an auricle without a ventricle, or anyway a
sac like an auricle, or the vein itself, dilated in one
place, pulsates. This is seen in hornets, bees, and
other insects, in experiments on which I think Ι can
show not only a pulse but also a respiration in that
part called a tail. This can be seen to lengthen and
contract, sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly, as
the insect seems to be blown up and to need more air.
But more of this in the Treatise on Respiration.⁸
Likewise it is clear that the auricles beat, contract,
and, as I said before, push blood into the ventricles.
So wherever there is a ventricle, an auricle is needed.
Not alone, as commonly believed, to be a receptacle
and store-house for blood. For what use is a pulsation
in retaining? The auricles exist as the initial motive
power of the blood. Especially the right auricle, the
first to live and the last to die, as said before. They
are necessary in order to cast the blood conveniently
into the ventricles. These, continually contracting,
throw out more fully and forcibly the blood already
in motion, just as a ball-player can send a ball harder
and farther by striking it on a rebound than if he
simply throws it. Moreover, contrary to common
opinion, neither the heart nor anything else can draw
anything into itself by dilating or distending, unless
like a sponge previously compressed, while it is return-

 

⁸ If the Treatise on Respiration was written, it was probably
destroyed by the Parliamentary soldiers who sacked Harvey’s rooms
in Whitehall in 1642, when Harvey was with Charles I at Edgehill.
