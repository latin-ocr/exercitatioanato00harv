MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

We should not let the thickness of the arterial
walls mislead us into believing that the pulsating
power moves along them from the heart.⁶ In some
animals the arteries do not differ from the veins,
and in the distant parts of the body where the ar-
teries are finely divided‚ as in the brain and hand,
no-one can tell arteries from veins by their walls,
for the tunics are the same in both. In an aneurysm
arising from an injured or eroded artery, the pulse
is just the same as in the other arteries, but it has no
arterial tunic. The renowned Riolan supports me
in this in his 7th Book.

It is not to be supposed that the function of the
pulse is the same as that of respiration because the
respiration is made more frequent and powersul,
as Galen says, by the same causes as running, bath-
ing or any other heating agent. Not only is ex-
perience opposed to this (though Galen strives to
get around it), when by immoderate gorging the
pulse becomes great and the respiration less, but in
children the pulse is rapid when respiration is slow.
Likewise in sear, trouble, or worry, in many severs,
of course, the pulse is very fast, the respiration
slower than usual.

 

⁶ As in a peristaltic wave. The clasticity of blood-vessel walls,
depending on their elastic fibers and smooth muscle tunics, is now
recognized as a factor in maintaining blood pressure. Harvey demon-
strated that the pulsation in the arteries is due to their sudden disten-
tion by blood forced out of the heart during its contraction. Andreas
Caesalpinus (1519-1603) argued this point in his ⁶Quaestiones Peri-
pateticae (Lib. V, Quaest. 4) in 1571, but without apparently impressing
any of the anatomical or medical investigators ofhis or the next century-
