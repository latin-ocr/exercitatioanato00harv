blood is continually poured into the arteries in a
greater amount than can be supplied by the food.
Since it all flows past in so short a time, it must be
made to flow in a circle.

Someone may say here that a great amount may

and that it all may come from the food. An ex-

mammae. A cow may give three or four, or even
