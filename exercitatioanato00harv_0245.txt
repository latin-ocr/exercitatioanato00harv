Chronology of William Harvey
m

1578. Born (April 1) at Folkestone, Kent, of Thomas
(a town official) and Joane Hawke Harvey, eldest of
“a week of sons, whereof this William was bred to
learning, his other brethren being bound apprentices

in London, and all at last ended in effect in mer-
chants.'' (Fuller).

1588. Excitement over and defeat of the Spanish Ar-
mada. How thrilled was Harvey entering Canterbury
Grammar School this year?

1593. Entered Caius CoIlege, Cambridge, implying
choice of medical career. Caesalpinus (1524-1603)
publishes Questiones Medicae, incidentally discussing
pulmonary and systemic circulation.

1597. Receives Bachelor's degree from Cambridge.
Expedition of Earl of Essex and Sir Walter Raleigh

1598. Began medical studies at Padua (in the elite
Universitas sumturum), scene of the triumphs of
Vesalius (1514-1564), R. Columbus (1516—1559)‚
Fallopius (1523-1562), and now of H. Fabricius of
Aquapendente (1537-1619), Casserius (1561—1616),
Galilei (1564—1642), and Sanctorius (1561-1636). Hav-
ing just erected a new anatomical theater, Fabricius
was loved and respected for his charity, skill‚ and learn-
ing. Harvey apparently became one of his favorite
pupils, and even helped in experiments (De generatione,
6th exercise).

Padua. Fabricius publishes his De formato fetu. Giro-
dano Bruno burned at Rome. Founding of East India
