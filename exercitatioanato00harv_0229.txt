MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

sunction is that of a muscle‚ to contract and to move
something, namely its content of blood.

As in the muscles themselves, the actions and uses
of the heart may be understood from the arrangement
of its fibers and the structure of its movable parts.
Anatomists generally agree with Galen that the heart
is composed of a variety of fibers arranged straight,
transversely, and obliquely. But in the boiled heart
the fibers are seen to be arranged otherwise. All
those in the walls and septum are circular as in a
sphincter whereas those in the bands are longitudi-
nally oblique.¹⁴ So when all these muscles contract
simultaneously the apex is pulled toward the base by
the bands and the walls are drawn together in a
sphere. The heart is contracted on all sides and the
ventricles are compressed. Hence it must be recog-
nized that since it acts by contraction, its function is
to pump blood into the arteries.

 

400 B. C., it describes the auriculo-ventricular and semilunar valves,
and the chordae tendinae. Air is said to enter the heart and change
the blood. The conception of the heart as a muscle is not usually
credited either to Harvey or the Hippocratic writer. It is charac-
teristic of Harvey to attempt to fortify his ideas by references to the
classical authorities. See Note 3, Chapter II.

¹⁴ Interesting that Harvey boiled the heart to get a clear picture
of its fibrous make-up. The best recent analysis of this subject was
made by F. P. Mall (Amer. J. Anat„ 2: 211, 1911). Mall describes
a deep and superficial “bulbospiral’' and “sinospiral’' system of
fibers which curve around from the base to the apex of the heart.
These form a sling-like support for the circular fibers which are especi-

ally thick on the left side. Harvey’s description is essentially correct.
