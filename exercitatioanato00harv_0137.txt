MOTION OF THE HEART AND BLOOD

by the erosion of the artery itself‚ it was daily getting
larger, and was distended with each pulsation by
the rush of blood from the arte-ry. Post mortem
examination showed the relation of the parts. The
pulse in this same arm was small because the greater
part of the blood to it was intercepted by the tumor.

Wherever the motion of the blood in the arteries
is impeded, by compression, by infarction, or by
interception‚ there is less pulsation distally,2 since
the beat of the arteries is nothing else than the
impulse of blood in these vessels.

 

² It is remarkable that the clinical applications of Harvey's work
were so long neglected. Here and later he clearly indicates how his
views may aid in diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. The practicing
physicians, however, would have none of it. Even some manuscript
notes of Wm. Cullen’s (1712-1790) lectures on the Praetice of Physic,
over a century later, only refer casually to the use of Dr. Harvey’s
observations on the control of hemorrhage. It may be that the practi-
cal success of Thomas Sydenham (1624-1689) as a physician focused
attention on the neat pigeon-holing scheme of his classification of
disease by symptoms (nosology), so that the applications of theunew
work in anatomy and physiology to medicine were overlooked.
