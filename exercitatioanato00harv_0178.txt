AN ANATOMICAL STUDY ΟΝ ΤΗΕ

The matter is obvious in animal experimentation.
If an opening be cut not only in the aorta, but even
in a small artery, as Galen claims, in man, the whole
blood content may be drained from the entire body,
from veins as well as arteries‚ in almost half an
hour’s time.

Butchers can also well enough confirm this point.
In killing an ox by cutting the arteries of the neck,
the whole mass of blood may be drained off and
all the vessels emptied in less than a quarter of an
hour. We know how quickly an excessive hemor-
rhage may occur in removing a tumor or in an
amputation.

The force of this argument would not be lost by
saying that blood flows equally if not more from
veins than from arteries‚ in butchering or amputa-
ting. The contrary of this really holds. Because they
collapse, and have no power to propel blood, and
because there is a block where the valves are placed,
as shall be shown later, the veins really pour out
little blood. The arteries, however, squirt it out in
quantities, with force, as if ejected from a syringe.
The matter may be tested by cutting the artery
in the neck of a sheep or dog, but leaving the vein
alone, and it will easily be seen with how much
force, in what amounts, and how quickly all the
blood in the body is drained, from veins as well
